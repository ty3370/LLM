0,2007,"Han, KS",The possibilities and limitations of gifted education in Korea: A look at the ISEP science-gifted education center,ASIA PACIFIC EDUCATION REVIEW,gifted education in Korea; science gifted education center; differentiated learning experience,ATTITUDES,"Education for gifted children is currently one of the hottest educational issues in Korea. Much money and effort arebeing invested in this area of education. Recent announcements by the Korean Ministry of Education state that all children should be educated to the level of which they are capable, and the current program for gifted students should be and will be extended. However, there is little attention paid to the actual substance of gifted education in Korea. What is happening in the name of gifted education? What is the meaning of giftedness and gifted education? How and in what respects can the gifted program be differentiated from general programs? What are the problems and concerns in serving gifted students? What are the effects of gifted programs? These are the main questions of the present qualitative study. For the purposes of this ethnographic study, the ISEP science gifted education center in Korea was observed for a six-month period, and 10 professors and 50 students at the ISEP were interviewed in depth. The results of the study are as follows. First of all. the ISEP science gifted education center provides differentiated learning environments and teaching methods. Second, through these differentiated learning experiences, students improve their thinking skills and creative problem solving abilities, as well as developing positive self-esteem. In addition, the formation of human net works, the special meaning of the 'gifted' label, and the acquisition of personal knowledge were seen to be some of the major educative possibilities on offer at the ISEP gifted education center. However, some professors' low levels of motivation, the absence of individualized educational plans, bureaucratic management, weak student commitment to set tasks, and a lack of opportunity for students' social activities were clearly limitations of the ISEP gifted education center. The results of this study will contribute to, specifically, the search for new ideas to improve the operation of gifted education as well as helping to surmount the hidden problems lurking beneath the surface of the current gifted education practices in Korea, and, more generally, to enhance our understanding of the diverse gifted educational practices in operation worldwide.",5,5,Education & Educational Research

The main research question concerns how the current curriculum fits the learning needs of gifted students. For the purposes of the study, 16 compulsory and elective syllabi of science and technology school subjects were identified and qualitatively analyzed, and the role of activity days was examined within the target framework. The results show a rather weak operationalization of recommendations for gifted education in defined learning objectives and standards in the syllabi. Moreover, it was found that elective school subjects in science and technology are poorly represented in students' overall selection of elective school subjects. In addition, activity days offer numerous possibilities for the implementation of the general recommendations for teaching the gifted.",4,5,Education & Educational Research

We also explored ways to apply the characteristics of gifted classes suggeseted by the teachers of this study, which had a positive effect on science-gifted students, to general science classes. For this study, a PES survey was carried on middle school science-gifted students enrolled in the gifted education center in the central region and general middle school students in the same area who had no experience in gifted education. Based on the survey result, we conducted in-depth interviews with teachers, having teaching experience with both science-gifted and general students. The results revealed that science-gifted students showed a significantly higher PES index than general students in all five areas of PES. The area with the largest difference between the two groups was science-related self-concept and the smallest was science academic emotion. Teachers suggested ways to apply the characteristics of science-gifted classes to general science classes, such as organizing general science classes around inquiry activities, supporting class materials such as MBL or tablets, reconstructing the classes using materials reflecting students' needs, and changing the textbook content and narrative style, to induce students' interest and curiosity. Based on the study results, ways to enhance the PES through science classes for general students were proposed.",0,0,Geology

The sample of the study consists of 90 secondary school students (5th, 6th, 7th and 8th grade) studying in Malatya BILSEM in 2016-2017 academic year. As data collection tool, the Attitude Towards Science Scale (TOSRA) was used. It consists 40 items and was developed by Fraser (1981) and adapted to Turkish language and culture by Telli, Cakiroglu and Rakici (2003) with 9th and 10th grade students. In this study, the validity and the reliability studies of the scale were done due to the fact that the sample of the study is gifted secondary school students. As a result of the validity and reliability analysis seven-factor structure consisting of 29 items was obtained. While all 29 items in the model explained 69.7 % of the variance, the reliability coefficient of Cronbach Alpha was determined as.94. Because of that the violation of normal distribution assumptions, non-parametric tests of Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal Wallis H were used. When the results are examined, gifted secondary school students' attitudes towards science do not differ significantly in terms of gender (U=897.50, p=.36>.05), school type (U=945.50, p=.82>.05), number of siblings (X2=1.613, p=.446>.05), and education level of the family (mother: X2=6.958, p=.22>.05; father: X2=5.919, p=.31>.05).

Cultivation of positive attitudes towards gifted education is important to ensure that gifted students receive educational opportunities appropriate to their learning needs. Objective. To examine the attitudes of students, parents, and teachers towards gifted education in the Slovenian upper secondary schools. Design. A total of 1,020 students from four sdective co-educational upper secondary schools (i.e., gymnasiums), their teachers (n=84), and parents (n = 3 0 6) participated in the study. Respondents' attitudes were assessed using an adapted version of the Gagne and Nadeau attitude survey about gifted students and their education. In order to obtain a deeper insight into the context, an open question about gifted education was also posed. Results. Participants generally hold neutral to positive attitudes towards gifted education. They expressed their awareness of gifted students' special academic needs and the meaningfulness of specific educational support. Furthermore, 68% of participating students emphasized the need for relatedness to their peers (i.e., not to stand out or be labelled), often neglected in provisions for the gifted. Comparative analysis showed that attitudes towards the extent of knowledge and experience in the field differed among the groups of participants. Conclusion. Qualitative analysis complemented the quantitative findings by addressing the principle of challenging instead of the principle of adding, suggesting that the focus should be primarily on adapting the curricula and, out of consideration for their social and emotional needs in adolescence, not on overloading gifted students.",3,3,Psychology

Metaphors are used to connect abstract ideas and information to more concrete experiences, thus making these experiences more familiar and easier to understand. Moreover, metaphors are more than symbolic intellectual processes; they influence the conceptual understanding of our experiences and help define our everyday realities. For education, there is an important and relevant practical connection between the metaphors that teachers employ and their beliefs about teaching and classroom practices. This stems from the notion that metaphors guide one's mental framework. In order to gain a deeper understanding of the metaphors influencing teachers in gifted education, this study specifically asked teachers to describe both their metaphors concerning gifted students as well as those influencing their teaching. In this study, nine different themes were identified. This research demonstrates a clear connection between reported metaphors and how gifted students receive their education from teachers.

While special education's terminology has become more nuanced and circumspect over the ensuing century, the term gifted has remained unchanged despite coming under substantial criticism in recent decades for its lack of specificity and for the innateness that the term implies as the primary cause of individual differences in ability. We examine this history and the seminal nationally disseminated reports related to gifted education, from the Marland report to the present, to consider why the gifted label has persisted. We conclude with some suggestions for how these issues might be remedied.",0,0,Psychology

In this study, an original checklist was developed to identify gifted characteristics specific to science learning among twice-exceptional primary school children in Japan. The checklist consisted of 60 items on Attitudes, Thinking, Skills, and Knowledge/Understanding. A total of 86 children from eight primary schools in an urban area in Japan, 50% of whom had Learning Disabilities (LD), Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), and/or High-functioning Autism (HA), were observed using the checklist. Factor analysis revealed three factors. A cluster analysis with the subscale points of each factor identified three ogifted styleso in science. These were: (1) Spontaneous Style; (2) Expert Style; and (3) Solid Style. LD/ADHD/HA children characteristically displayed a Spontaneous Style while the non- LD/ADHD/HA children were characterized by the Solid Style. In both subject groups, the number of Expert Style children was the lowest with no significant difference in their numbers. Based on the results of this research, this paper discusses the implications of the findings for teaching science to twice-exceptional children and argues the benefits of inclusive science education for children with and without mild developmental disorders.",7,8,Education & Educational Research

Gifted are exceptional children with special qualities and needs and we try showing our preoccupations towards the problematic of children with high potential towards finding the most adequate methods for developing their potential according with their interest. This aspect is marked by the necessity of recognizing individual differences. Gifted children need adequate educational opportunities to develop their inborn aptitude potential. So that we tried to draw a model which could be implemented to the level of gifted children in order to develop their inborn potentials. With a view to educating gifted children, specialists in the field have worked out many methods and procedures. Of the multitude of procedures and methods we shall, in this study, concentrate upon a methodology that combines several methods: amplification, enrichment of the curriculum, blending with differentiation/individualization of instruction in heterogeneous levels classes and mentoring outside classes, which we shall integrate into a formative strategy called by us Personalized Model of Education for Gifted Children. The main components of this special methodology are: enrichment of the curriculum, differentiation of instruction and mentoring for gifted children. The activities proposed will be implemented as special academic programs in the regular classroom, or as a pull-in/out-of class programs. The list of the full curriculum units is based on selections from the domains of interest of the gifted children: music, art, math, language, chemistry, physics, and many others. The students will be able to develop their inborn aptitude in an appropriate way. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",6,7,Education & Educational Research

The respondents' attitudes were assessed using the Gagne and Nadeau attitude survey (1991) about gifted students and gifted education (which was translated into Croatian and subjected to metric validation to meet the needs of this study). The results show that teachers generally have a neutral attitude toward the gifted, meaning that teachers recognize the needs, support and social value of the gifted, but lack a clearly defined attitude toward special provisions for the gifted and toward the consequences special support of the gifted might have. The study revealed differences in attitudes toward the gifted, interest and perceived knowledge of giftedness with regard to the years of teaching experience, education level and workplace. Hierarchical regression analyses proved interest and individual professional improvement, in topics concerning giftedness, to be significant predictors of attitudes toward the needs, support and value of the gifted.

This paper aims to offer suggestions for the appropriate education system to enlarge their knowledge and creativity, without disturbing their usual life and educational surroundings. The author uses a comparative method, focusing on different countries worldwide and comparing and interpreting the various concepts of education in those countries. Based on the United Nations regionalization, the author focuses on the countries of the Eastern European Group (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Hungary, and Serbia) and Western European and Others Group (Austria, Germany, Netherlands, UK, Turkey, and the USA). The study finds that inclusive education as an alternative framework is potentially the best education system for gifted students. The prevailing opinion in most countries is that the concept of inclusive education primarily refers to children with special needs. This authorexplains that there is no logical obstacle to applying inclusive education to gifted students as well. Such an inclusive education system would require changing current education systems and programs and, most of all, hiring various professional staff as social workers and trained teachers who can meet the various demanding needs of gifted students in any community. The study concludes that it is necessary to improve existing policies in education to provide the inclusive education framework to gifted children and to understand that the essence is not only to agree on differences but to stimulate the individuality and diversity of the gifted at all levels; the greatest gem of each country is its educated children. Inclusion of gifted students has a positive outcome not only for the individual but also for the other students in the classroom. Gifted students stimulate the others, pushing them to reach their potential academic capabilities. Also, the unidentified students who could learn at elevated levels could benefit from this kind of education model and a high level of instruction could push them in the same way that it challenges the gifted students in the classroom.",2,3,Social Work

The question is how to design and develop education that fits and further supports such characteristics and competencies of gifted pupils. Analysis of various types of educational interventions for gifted pupils reflects positive cognitive or intellectual effects and differentiated social comparison or group-related effects on these pupils. Systemic preventive combination of such interventions could make these more effective and sustainable. The systemic design is characterised by three conditional dimensions: differentiation of learning materials and procedures; integration by and use of information and communication technology (ICT) support; and strategies to improve development and learning. The relationships to diagnostic, instructional, managerial, and systemic learning aspects are expressed in guidelines to develop or transform education. The guidelines imply the facilitation of learning arrangements that provide flexible self-regulation for gifted pupils. A three-year pilot in Dutch nursery and primary school was conducted to develop and implement the design in collaboration with teachers. The results constitute prototypes of structured competence domains and supportive software. These support the screening of entry characteristics of all four-year-old pupils and assignment of adequate play and learning processes and activities throughout the school career. Gifted and other pupils are supported to work at their actual achievement or competency levels since their start in nursery school, in self-regulated learning arrangements either in or out of class. Each pupil can choose other pupils to collaborate with in small groups, at self-chosen tasks or activities, while being coached by the teacher. Formative evaluation of the school development process shows that the systemic prevention guidelines seem to improve learning and social progress of gifted pupils, including their self-regulation. Further development and implementation steps are discussed.",12,13,Education & Educational Research

The aim was to determine the degree of teachers' self-assessment in terms of work with gifted pupils in the classroom and to compare their self-assessment in regard to their teaching practice length, personal experience with gifted pupils in the classroom and previous education in the area of giftedness. The results show that the overall rate of teachers' self-assessment is slightly positive. Comparison of the results shows expected outcomes. Teachers who have shorter practice, less experience and training in the area of gifted pupils, declare poorer self-assessment. On the contrary, teachers who have longer practice, more experience and education, declare better self-assessment.

Terman's mixed legacy includes the pioneering work in the creation of intelligence tests, the first large-scale longitudinal study, and the earliest discussions of gifted identification, curriculum, ability grouping, acceleration, and more. However, since the 1950s, Terman has been viewed as a sloppy thinker at best and a racist, sexist, and/or classist at worst. This article explores the most common criticisms of Terman's legacy: an overemphasis on IQ, support for the meritocracy, and emphasizing genetic explanations for the origin of intelligence differences over environmental ones. Each of these criticisms is justified to some extent by the historical record, and each is relevant today. Frequently overlooked, however, is Terman's willingness to form a strong opinion based on weak data. The article concludes with a discussion of the important lessons that Terman's work has for modern educators and psychologists, including his contributions to psychometrics and gifted education, his willingness to modify his opinions in the face of new evidence, and his inventiveness and inclination to experiment. Terman's legacy is complex, but one that provides insights that can enrich modern researchers and practitioners in these areas.",9,9,Education & Educational Research; Psychology

High-achieving students in rural communities may face additional barriers to STEM learning that can limit their ability to pursue advanced STEM studies and occupations. This small-scale research project sought to explore a group of gifted lower secondary students' engagement and experiences in a STEM programme designed around a local rural knowledge model as reported by Avery (2013), which uses local knowledge as a vehicle for science learning. This multi-method study was conducted with 26 students years 7 and 8 in a rural school. Information about students' general science class experiences were collected quantitatively. These experiences contrasted the local rural knowledge programme, where the students worked with an ecologist and experienced science educators to rehabilitate small plots of damaged land close to the school site. Qualitative data were collected throughout the programme to determine its influence on students' engagement and learning in STEM. The research found that the local rural knowledge model enhanced students' engagement in STEM learning and they felt that they retained knowledge better as a result of the authentic learning experience. Students also engaged the wider community in the process, leading to broader translation of the STEM learning.",7,7,Education & Educational Research

Here pupils are familiarized with humanitarian culture. Today as the analysis of pedagogical literature and general education practice shows a sufficient experience of teaching gifted school students was accumulated. At the same time there are unresolved questions of how teaching linguistically gifted school students a foreign language (FL) has to be organized so that it satisfied their requirements. There is also a question what role AFLE of school students should play in this process. The objective of the research: what scientific principles and technologies are necessary for the formation of linguistically gifted school students' humanitarian culture in the conditions of AFLE. The questions of the research: 1. To specify the theoretical bases of the formation of pupils' humanitarian culture in the context of AFLE. 2. To determine the basic principles, the pedagogical conditions and the main characteristics of the methodological control of linguistically gifted pupils in the course of their studying a FL in the system of AFLE. 3. To test experimentally the program for linguistically gifted school students Travelling around English-Speaking Countries and two elective courses The Russian and the English speech etiquette: the similarities and distinctions, The humanistic tendencies in the English and American literature, which promoted the formation of their humanitarian culture in the educational environment of AFLE. For the confirmation of the hypotheses we used the following methods and tools of the research: analytical methods of a research (the theoretical analysis of philosophical, pedagogical, methodological literature on the problem of the research, the analysis of statistical data), sociometric methods of a research (questionnaires, tests, a poll, an interview, an expert assessment). The methods of the observation (direct and indirect observations), the methods of mathematical statistics were of great importance too. In our opinion, AFLE of school students is of great value as a teacher of a FL can practice the use of the main psychologically focused models of training a FL at school. In this case the contents and the forms of school language education, and AFLE in particular, will correspond to the child's psychology, his rights and interests. On the basis of the analysis of theoretical and methodological literature we developed the concept of the formation of linguistically gifted school students' humanitarian culture in the course of teaching them in the system of AFLE. The analysis of the results of the skilled and experimental work allowed us to establish that the suggested pedagogical terms, forms, methods, means and technologies of the implementation of the experimental program and the elective courses considerably increased school students' interest in culture, history, literature of the countries of the target language. The pupils' horizon was broadened considerably thanks to reading the works of the English and American literature. The school students' communicative skills were created.

Through a simplified example, we show that local building-level norms are best at diversifying gifted programs when schools are highly segregated. Conversely, when achievement gaps are present and a uniform admissions cutoff is applied, building-level norms in highly integrated schools produce highly segregated gifted programs.

Much of this gap has been blamed on the deficit or narrow view to inclusive education that focuses only on the education for disabled students, against the broader view of inclusive education, which deals with all students in danger of marginalisation. In the deficit/narrow view, mathematically gifted students are neglected, and this is detrimental to national efforts towards producing the much-needed 21(st) century skills. The question at stake then is the origin of this narrow view-is it how inclusive education is conceptualised in the policy framework or is it more about the discretion of the actors in the implementation context? This paper analysed 3 international, 3 national inclusive policy documents and surveyed 51 foundation-phase teachers' perceptions and practices with the aim of understanding the extent to which gifted students were accommodated in those policy documents and practices. Vygostky's defectology theory was used as a lens to judge whether the dominant view to inclusive education was narrow or broad. Results show that although both the narrow and broad views are mentioned, the dominant view in both policy and practice was the narrow view to inclusive education. Similar South African studies have shown how an egalitarian and equalising approach to education would leave the gifted learner with minimal attention. Consistent with previous studies, our recommendation is that respect for difference can only be cultivated if those responsible for enacting educational practices are supported by consistent and coherent policy messages, which value skills development by challenging the deficit view to inclusive education.",0,0,Education & Educational Research

The problem now, as 40 years ago, is that gifted students often are taught science courses at a more intensive level, but without their truly learning how to think scientifically. We argue that students of science need not only learn the content of science courses, but also learn, at a deep level, how to think scientifically. Our model addresses the issue of what this deep level consists of. Level I involves Teaching Scientific Knowledge. Level II involves Teaching Scientific Problem Solving.

In the study, exploratory sequential mixed methods design, one of the mixed method designs, was used. The sample of the study consisted of 168 gifted students who continued their education at a Science and Art Center (SAC) in a city in Eastern Anatolia Region of Turkey in the 2018-2019 academic years. Quantitative data were collected using Lifelong Learning Scale (LLS) and Perceived Self-Regulation Scale (PSRS). Qualitative data of the study were collected by semi-structured interviews conducted with 15 students. The quantitative data of the study were analyzed by independent samples t test, ANOVA and Pearson Product-Moment Correlation analysis. In the analysis of the qualitative data, inductive content analysis was used. As a result of the analysis, it was found that the total scores obtained from the Lifelong Learning Scale and the Perceived Self-regulation Scale did not show a significant difference by gender and program variables. It has been determined that there is a moderate significant relationship between lifelong learning tendencies of gifted students and their perceptions about self-regulation skills. When the opinions of the gifted students about lifelong learning tendencies are examined, it is seen that participants determine the reasons of the problems and go for solutions in line with their purpose, they like to produce solutions by making intellectual struggles, and they make scientific and non-scientific readings and use these readings to produce different solutions. It was also seen that they tried different ways to correct their mistakes. Based on these findings, it can be said that individuals with high perceptions about self-regulatory learning skills have high lifelong learning tendencies. In this context, it is recommended to enrich Science and Art Center's curriculum in order to improve students' self-regulation skills and developing lifelong learning tendencies.",2,2,Education & Educational Research

In Croatia, the inclusive setting is predominantly associated with the placement of students with disabilities in regular classes where teachers also work with gifted students and must provide appropriate learning opportunities to both groups. Most research is focused on the competencies of teachers or students in teacher education study programs for teaching children with disabilities, and less on the competences for teaching gifted students. Also, in Croatian initial teacher education there are scarce opportunities to prepare students for teaching children with disabilities and even fewer opportunities to prepare them to work with gifted students, so we expect that students will be more critical of their competences to work with gifted students. The main aim of the research was to examine students cognitive and emotional components of competence for inclusive teaching separately for students with disabilities and gifted students. Also, we wanted to investigate if these components are correlated and whether students differ in their assessments on these components concerning gifted children and children with disabilities. The study included 218 participants enrolled in teacher education study programs at two departments that offer such programs in Croatia: the Faculty of Teacher Education at the University of Rijeka and the Faculty for the Educational Sciences at the University Juraj Dobrila in Pula. Cognitive and Emotional Components of Inclusive Teaching Scale (CECITS) was modified and used to assess different components relevant to teacher self-assessed competence to teach children with disabilities and gifted children. When participants assessed components of their ability to conduct inclusive teaching with these two specific groups of children, for both groups the relationship between the cognitive and emotional component was not established. This is a replication of previous findings obtained on children with disabilities, and the same finding has also been confirmed in this research that included gifted children. On the other hand, high positive correlations were found between students' assessments of cognitive components regarding children with disabilities and gifted children. Also, high positive correlations were found between students' assessments of emotional components regarding children with disabilities and gifted children. We also found that participants had significantly lower scores for both cognitive and emotional components when evaluating their ability to work with gifted children and higher scores when children with disabilities were in focus. This finding reflects the content and opportunities provided by teacher education study programs in selected Croatian universities. In these study programs, the learning outcomes related to teaching students with disabilities are predominantly contained in only one compulsory course, and learning outcomes for teaching gifted students are even less represented as they are offered only as an elective course about gifted students.

Succeeding theories and empirical investigations have often built on earlier work, complementing or sometimes clashing over conceptions of talent or contesting the mechanisms of talent development. Some have even suggested that giftedness itself is a misnomer, mistaken for the results of endless practice or social advantage. In surveying the landscape of current knowledge about giftedness and gifted education, this monograph will advance a set of interrelated arguments: The abilities of individuals do matter, particularly their abilities in specific talent domains; different talent domains have different developmental trajectories that vary as to when they start, peak, and end; and opportunities provided by society are crucial at every point in the talent-development process. We argue that society must strive to promote these opportunities but that individuals with talent also have some responsibility for their own growth and development. Furthermore, the research knowledge base indicates that psychosocial variables are determining influences in the successful development of talent. Finally, outstanding achievement or eminence ought to be the chief goal of gifted education. We assert that aspiring to fulfill one's talents and abilities in the form of transcendent creative contributions will lead to high levels of personal satisfaction and self-actualization as well as produce yet unimaginable scientific, aesthetic, and practical benefits to society. To frame our discussion, we propose a definition of giftedness that we intend to be comprehensive. Giftedness is the manifestation of performance that is clearly at the upper end of the distribution in a talent domain even relative to other high-functioning individuals in that domain. Further, giftedness can be viewed as developmental in that in the beginning stages, potential is the key variable; in later stages, achievement is the measure of giftedness; and in fully developed talents, eminence is the basis on which this label is granted. Psychosocial variables play an essential role in the manifestation of giftedness at every developmental stage. Both cognitive and psychosocial variables are malleable and need to be deliberately cultivated. Our goal here is to provide a definition that is useful across all domains of endeavor and acknowledges several perspectives about giftedness on which there is a fairly broad scientific consensus. Giftedness (a) reflects the values of society; (b) is typically manifested in actual outcomes, especially in adulthood; (c) is specific to domains of endeavor; (d) is the result of the coalescing of biological, pedagogical, psychological, and psychosocial factors; and (e) is relative not just to the ordinary (e. g., a child with exceptional art ability compared to peers) but to the extraordinary (e. g., an artist who revolutionizes a field of art). In this monograph, our goal is to review and summarize what we have learned about giftedness from the literature in psychological science and suggest some directions for the field of gifted education. We begin with a discussion of how giftedness is defined (see above). In the second section, we review the reasons why giftedness is often excluded from major conversations on educational policy, and then offer rebuttals to these arguments. In spite of concerns for the future of innovation in the United States, the education research and policy communities have been generally resistant to addressing academic giftedness in research, policy, and practice. The resistance is derived from the assumption that academically gifted children will be successful no matter what educational environment they are placed in, and because their families are believed to be more highly educated and hold above-average access to human capital wealth. These arguments run counter to psychological science indicating the need for all students to be challenged in their schoolwork and that effort and appropriate educational programing, training and support are required to develop a student's talents and abilities. In fact, high-ability students in the United States are not faring well on international comparisons. The scores of advanced students in the United States with at least one college-educated parent were lower than the scores of students in 16 other developed countries regardless of parental education level. In the third section, we summarize areas of consensus and controversy in gifted education, using the extant psychological literature to evaluate these positions. Psychological science points to several variables associated with outstanding achievement. The most important of these include general and domain-specific ability, creativity, motivation and mindset, task commitment, passion, interest, opportunity, and chance. Consensus has not been achieved in the field however in four main areas: What are the most important factors that contribute to the acuities or propensities that can serve as signs of potential talent? What are potential barriers to acquiring the gifted label? What are the expected outcomes of gifted education? And how should gifted students be educated? In the fourth section, we provide an overview of the major models of giftedness from the giftedness literature. Four models have served as the foundation for programs used in schools in the United States and in other countries. Most of the research associated with these models focuses on the precollegiate and early university years. Other talent-development models described are designed to explain the evolution of talent over time, going beyond the school years into adult eminence (but these have been applied only by out-of-school programs as the basis for educating gifted students). In the fifth section we present methodological challenges to conducting research on gifted populations, including definitions of giftedness and talent that are not standardized, test ceilings that are too low to measure progress or growth, comparison groups that are hard to find for extraordinary individuals, and insufficient training in the use of statistical methods that can address some of these challenges. In the sixth section, we propose a comprehensive model of trajectories of gifted performance from novice to eminence using examples from several domains. This model takes into account when a domain can first be expressed meaningfully-whether in childhood, adolescence, or adulthood. It also takes into account what we currently know about the acuities or propensities that can serve as signs of potential talent. Budding talents are usually recognized, developed, and supported by parents, teachers, and mentors. Those individuals may or may not offer guidance for the talented individual in the psychological strengths and social skills needed to move from one stage of development to the next. We developed the model with the following principles in mind: Abilities matter, domains of talent have varying developmental trajectories, opportunities need to be provided to young people and taken by them as well, psychosocial variables are determining factors in the successful development of talent, and eminence is the aspired outcome of gifted education. In the seventh section, we outline a research agenda for the field. This agenda, presented in the form of research questions, focuses on two central variables associated with the development of talent-opportunity and motivation-and is organized according to the degree to which access to talent development is high or low and whether an individual is highly motivated or not. Finally, in the eighth section, we summarize implications for the field in undertaking our proposed perspectives. These include a shift toward identification of talent within domains, the creation of identification processes based on the developmental trajectories of talent domains, the provision of opportunities along with monitoring for response and commitment on the part of participants, provision of coaching in psychosocial skills, and organization of programs around the tools needed to reach the highest possible levels of creative performance or productivity.",447,462,Psychology

In this context, differences teachers observed in these gifted children following the application of Renzulli's Type I Enrichment Method to preschool science activities were determined. The study has been conducted using the phenomenological approach as a qualitative research method. The benefits of enrichment methods on the education of gifted children and the need for their use as an early intervention method are well-recognized by the scientific community in this area. On the other hand, there are few research based results on the application of these Type-I Enrichment methods to preschool children. During the early childhood period, awareness related to this topic is particularly important due to both the support needs of parents for their children with special needs as well as the role of teachers in the entire educational-behavioral development process of the children. The study group in this study consists of four preschool teachers from four different classes in a private preschool within the 2015-2016 education year. In the beginning of the study, preschool teachers with gifted children in their classrooms received training courses with applied content on both gifted children and enrichment methods. Teachers who participated in the study subsequently used Renzulli's Type I enrichment methods to modify and enrich science activities within their classrooms throughout an entire semester. The teachers were then asked to evaluate the effects of enrichment activities on the children based on their own observations. The resulting findings were collected by the researcher through semi-structured interviews with these teachers. As a result, it was found that preschool teachers with gifted children in their classrooms indicate that early intervention is necessary for preschool gifted children, that the use of enrichment methods in this period is highly compatible with preschool pedagogy and curriculum and hence promises to be practical and sustainable and that enriched activities, in addition to their benefits for gifted children, may also offer benefits for children exhibiting normal development patterns under certain conditions. The results are then discussed in the context of enrichment, parent education, professionalization of teachers and preschool education providing richer benefits that are more sensitive to individual differences.",4,4,Education & Educational Research

However, in this paper we focus on what we believe is an often neglected and underdeveloped population, that of the gifted. We draw from the cognitive aptitude and gifted education research literatures to make the case that solutions to consequential real-world problems can be greatly enhanced by more fully developing the talents of the intellectually gifted population, which we operationalize in this paper as roughly the top 5% of cognitive talent. Should well-supported high achievers choose to solve them, these problems span health, science, economic growth, and areas unforeseen. We draw from longitudinal research on intellectually precocious students and retrospective research on leaders and innovators in society, showing that mathematical, verbal, and spatial aptitudes are linked to societal innovation. We then discuss two remaining fundamental challenges: the identification of disadvantaged and marginalized groups of students who have traditionally been neglected in selection for gifted programming suited to their current developmental needs, and the building of skills beyond academic ones, specifically in the related areas of open-minded thinking and intellectual humility.",5,5,Psychology

This leads to students that are more motivated and therefore higher achieving. Especially gifted students need these extra challenges to develop their full potential. Based on this research, a talent club for gifted students of primary schools, aged between 6 and 10 years, was designed at the Johannes Kepler University in Linz, Austria. Participants in this talent club are challenged with interdisciplinary projects within the STEM fields that demand a variety of approaches to create curiosity and interest for science and research. In this club, students work in teams on creative ideas to improve their STEM skills and their ability to connect different fields to complete their projects successfully. This paper describes the background, the aims and the content of the JKU COOL Mini Club at the Johannes Kepler University Linz, as well as the comparison of qualitative feedback of students before and after they attended the club. The interviews show that the students' view on computer science - especially about the value and advantages - changed from a very vague idea to specific examples of computer science impact and importance in the everyday life. The expectations to computer science projects changed as well from very general ideas to the interest in solving specific problems using digital competencies.

The purpose of the study is to explore scientific and pedagogical support for the professional development of teachers in their work with gifted adolescents and its innovation component (on an example of chemistry teachers). It was revealed that scientific and pedagogical support integrates the five implemented in practice independent modules. It was found that innovation component is best reflected in the conditions of the first module. It is associated with the use of new chemical equipment, modern information and communication technologies, and combined work experience on the basis of lyceum for talented children, unique pedagogical chemistry workshops; it is characterized by strong interactivity and performance by the students of creative project-oriented final reports. The materials of the article have the practical value for students - the future school teachers and university professors, for participants of the refresher courses and educationalists.

Questionnaires were filled out by 1975 Grade 3 to 6 students (10.5% gifted according to teacher nominations) and their teachers (n = 80) from eleven primary schools in the Netherlands. Teacher reports indicated that teachers provided gifted students with more autonomy, less structure, and equal levels of involvement compared to non-gifted students. Furthermore, gifted students perceived equal levels of autonomy satisfaction and relatedness satisfaction with their teachers, but reported more competence satisfaction, and less relatedness satisfaction with classmates than non-gifted students. Gifted students also reported higher levels of adaptive as well as more maladaptive forms of motivation than non-gifted students. Finally, relations between need support, need satisfaction, and motivation were similar for gifted students and non-gifted students, indicating that, similar to non-gifted students, motivation of gifted students can be fostered when their basic psychological needs are satisfied.",17,18,Psychology

However, in order to make the world a better place, mere understanding about socioscientific issues is not enough. Action must also be taken. In this study, 35 international gifted students-potential scientists-aged 15-19 were interviewed to investigate what they were doing to make the world a better place. The interviews were analyzed using qualitative content analysis with focus on students' actions toward a better world, their rationalizations for such actions, and the role of science in the rationalizations. The analysis shows that students consciously take a wide range of actions, and that they see citizenship as a process of constant self-development. The three categories created to highlight the variation in the ways students take action were personally responsible actions, participatory actions, and preparing for future. Although many students saw that science and scientists play a big role in solving especially the environmental problems, most of them also discussed the structural causes for problems, as well as the interplay of social, economic, and political forces. The results indicate that citizenship science education should take the variety of students' actions into consideration, give students the possibility to take individual and participatory action, as well as give students opportunities to get to know and discuss the ways a career in science or engineering can contribute to saving the world.",39,41,Education & Educational Research

We classify gifts into monetary and nonmonetary gifts. The findings from two scenario-based experiments indicate that a monetary gift versus a nonmonetary gift decreases gift acceptability through the increased level of perceived manipulation (PM) and face threat (FT) and these indirect effects are contingent on different guanxi types. The mediating roles of both PM and FT turn more significant when relational closeness (gift recipient's status relative to giver) increases.

Nowadays, the development of national competitiveness depends on many factors, but the quality of human capital is first of all. One of priority tasks of education system in Russian Federation is search and support of gifted children and teenagers: creation of conditions for their productive education, full upbringing and optimum development of their abilities providing further maximum self-realisation of a person. Today, however, the implementation of these requirements is real only in megalopolises, large regional centers, but not in small cities, which have no sufficient resources and environment conditions, cultivating potential of every gifted child, especially in the case of art talent. The shortage of highly skilled teachers and cultural industry, weak involvement into cultural life (inability to attend concerts, theatrical performances, exhibitions, etc.), very limited access to participation in creative competitions, olympiads, competitions - all this negatively affects motivation engage in art activity and can lead to serious personal crises and waste of talent. The aim of the article was to reveal the content of models of work with musically gifted children, who have certain problems that block their creative development. Methodology and research methods. The research was based on personally-oriented and system-based approaches to education of gifted children. The authors considered the ideas of Russian and foreign researchers about the need for pedagogical support of gifted children, who have problems in general and cultural development. The methods of theoretical analysis of scientific and scientific-methodological resources, comparative analysis of the results of practical activity, generalisation, oral and written survey and modeling were employed. Results and scientific novelty. The most common challenges of the development of gifted children, who live in towns, are revealed: lack of motivation for creativity and further development; a low level of general culture; tense atmosphere in family, which is expressed most often in the inattentive relation of parents to interests and abilities of a child. The specialists of Ural Musical College and children's art schools of the city of Ekaterinburg and Sverdlovsk region developed and approved the models of social and pedagogical support of gifted children to eliminate the causes of their failures in education. According to the classification of problems in the development of gifted children, three types of personally-oriented models are offered: 1) motivation to creative activity, 2) cultural self-enrichment, 3) conditions for creative development of the child in family. The realisation of each model should be based on close cooperation of staff members of specialised centres (e.g. in musical college) for work with musically gifted children, teachers of children's music schools, teachers of educational institutions of towns, children and their parents. The most effective activities, contributing to the solution of the formulated tasks of each model, are identified: concert-performing, cultural-educational and analytical (fixation and reflection of the results of creative development). Practical significance. The experimental testing of models proved the efficiency and possibility of complete and partial use of their components in Russian schools in order to manage the process of development of musically gifted pupils.",2,2,Education & Educational Research

Data were collected from a 10th-grade gifted student's problem-solving process in a qualitative research design. It was observed that the gifted student's ways of generalizing the linear and nonlinear patterns were different. In a generalization process, the student used figural reasoning in the linear pattern and numerical reasoning in the nonlinear patterns.

However, apart from the investigation of the 9-round linear hull effect in the design document, we find no linear attack result on GIFT-64. Although we do not doubt the security of GIFT-64 regarding the linear cryptanalysis, the actual resistance of the cipher to the linear attack should be evaluated since it promotes a comprehensive perception of the soundness of GIFT-64. Motivated by this observation, we implement an automatic search and find a 12-round linear distinguisher whose dominating trail is an optimal linear characteristic. Following that, the first 19-round linear attack is launched by utilising the newly identified distinguisher. On the other side, we notice that the previous differential attack of GIFT-64 covering 20 rounds claims the entire codebook. To reduce the data complexity of the 20-round attack, we apply the automatic method to exhaustively check 13-round differential trails with probabilities no less than 2-64 and identify multiple 13-round differentials facilitating 20-round attacks without using the full codebook. One of the candidate differentials with the maximum probability and the minimum number of guessed subkey bits is then employed to realise the first 20-round differential attack without relying on the complete codebook. Given the newly obtained results, we conjecture that the resistances of GIFT-64 against differential and linear attacks do not have a significant gap.

Design.-A mailed survey conducted in 1994 and 1995 of 3394 faculty who conduct life science research at the 50 universities that received the most research funding from the National Institutes of Health in 1993. Setting.-Research-intensive universities. Participants.-A total of 2167 of the 3394 faculty responded to the survey (response rate, 64%). Main Outcome Measures.-The percentage of faculty who received a research-related gift from a company in the last 3 years, the perceived importance of gifts to respondents' research, and what, if anything, the recipient thought the donor(s) expected in return for the gift. Results.-Forty-three percent of respondents received a research-related gift in the last 3 years independent of a grant or contract. The most frequently received gifts were biomaterials (24%), discretionary funds (15%), research equipment and trips to meetings (11% each), support for students (9%), and other research-related gifts (3%). Of those who received a gift, 66% reported the gift was important to their research, More than half of the recipients reported that donors expected the following in return for the gift: acknowledgment in publications (63%), that the gift not be passed on to a third party (60%), and that the gift be used only for the agreed-on purposes (59%). A total of 32% of recipients reported that the donor wanted prepublication review of any articles or reports stemming from the use of the gift, 30% indicated the company expected testing of their products, and 19% indicated that a donor expected ownership of all patentable results from the research in which a gift was used. However, what recipients thought donors expected differed by the type of gift received. Conclusions.-Research-related gifts are a common and important form of research support for academic life scientists. However, recipients frequently think that donors place restrictions and expect returns that may be problematic for recipients as well as institutions.",87,89,General & Internal Medicine

Changes in epistemological reasoning occur similarly to other stage-based developmental schemes, with qualitative shifts in worldviews at each stage. Some research suggests that gifted students tend to develop higher levels of epistemological reasoning earlier than same-aged typically developing peers. The current study extends research in developmental differences to middle school students. A total of 189 sixth-, seventh-, and eighth-grade gifted or typical students completed the Learning Context Questionnaire.

Whenever foreign language learners express themselves in a second language, there is an anxiety about the image that is communicated through linguistic difficulties. There is a fear that his personal image will be distorted because of grammatical errors and rarefied vocabulary. This study aims to research foreign language anxiety among gifted students who are attending science, math and art classes in Science and Art Centers (BILSEM). For this purpose, 146 (81 males and 65 female) gifted and talented students aged 12-17 were selected. This study used a mixed (quantitative method and qualitative) thereby applying a Foreign Language Anxiety Scale (for English language) to participants and using semi-structured interview questions with 10 gifted students (5 sciences, 2 arts and 3 from music class).

The purposeful sample consisted of nine Black males between the ages of 14 and 18 years. Four categories of self-perceptions of academic ability and gifted potential emerged from the data. These included: (a) gifted high achievers; (b) gifted could do better high achievers; (c) gifted could do better situational nonachievers; and (d) gifted could do better underachievers. Science teachers' influences that referenced participants' academic achievement pointed to validation. Participants' perceptions regarding how science teachers' influenced their academic performance focused on science teachers' content knowledge. Power dynamics germane to Black male participants' value or worth that directed their efforts in science learning environments are discussed. Implications are posited for science teaching, science education programs, and future research. This research endeavor was based on two premises. The first premise is that Black males' self-perceptions of academic ability affect their science academic achievement. The second premise is that, given parental, peer, and community influences, science teachers have considerable influence on students' self-perceptions of academic ability. However, the focus of this research was not on parental influences, peer influences, or any potential influences that participants' communities may have on their academic achievement.

We then investigate the role of teacher discretion, leveraging research from political science suggesting that clients of government services from traditionally underrepresented groups benefit from diversity in the providers of those services, including teachers. Even after conditioning on test scores and other factors, Black students indeed are referred to gifted programs, particularly in reading, at significantly lower rates when taught by non-Black teachers, a concerning result given the relatively low incidence of assignment to own-race teachers among Black students.",168,168,Education & Educational Research

The author proposes and implements a project aimed at providing psychological and pedagogical support of gifted students; providing the teaching staff with the necessary knowledge and skills to work with gifted children, encouraging participants of the educational process to use the means of information and communication technologies (ICT) in educational activities; familiarizing students and their parents with the useful opportunities as well as the potential risks of using the Internet for personal development and social experience. It has been established that the formation of gifted students' behavior, including the Internet environment, is influenced by various factors at the following levels: individual, family, the level of the closest people (peers, educational institution) and public level, which determine the student's behavior on the Internet and form its specificity. A model of psychological support and support for participants in the educational process has been developed. The purpose, objectives, functions and technologies are stated in the model. The organizational and methodological implementation of the model involves all participants of the educational process: students, teachers, parents, administration of the institution to achieve the result: students acquire the status of their own life-creation and active member of society. An online testing platform was developed to conduct student surveys. Students and teachers used a set of diagnostic tools to identify socio-communicative features of development, to study the gifted students' value sphere, learning motivation, their overall level of socialization, regardless of students' location and time. It provides new ways and methods of working with gifted youth using ICT. The experiment showed positive shifts in socialization indicators in the experimental group relative to the control group at a significant level.

Compared to a randomized control condition, 12 h of spatial training (1) improved the skills to mentally rotate and visualize cross-sections of 3-D objects shortly after training, (2) narrowed gender differences in spatial skills shortly after training, and (3) improved examination scores in introductory physics (d=.38) but not for other STEM courses. After eight months, however, there were no training differences for spatial skills, STEM course grades, physics self-efficacy, or declared majors. Large gender differences, favoring males, persisted for some spatial skills, physics grades, and physics self-efficacy eight months after training.

Since hermeneutics means understanding, in the context of curriculum planning and programming in work with gifted students, it is important to consider the role and significance of identifying key assumptions for successful work with gifted ones as a key precondition for effectiveness. The aim is to put the emphasizes also on the role of key participants in the process of working with gifted students because of the clear division of everyone role both in the process of identifying the gifted as well as in the process of learning and teaching. Since work with gifted students is part of the process of inclusive education, whose successful implementation implies a clear definition of key assumptions, hermeneutical approach in this paper appears as a need for cyclical reflection in the curriculum planning and programming process. Since the hermeneutic circle places emphasis on a posteriori knowledge, the need for defining a clear theoretical frame in the process of planning and programming practical educational activities in working with gifted students is a purpose.

The vividly developed cognitive need in these children most often has a passive character, turning, in fact, only into an accumulation of knowledge, and therefore does not become the basis for the development of talent. As the main motivation necessary for the transformation of potential giftedness into talent, a special searching need is considered which manifests itself at an early age, but under the influence of society, including school education, it is significantly deformed and does not ensure the development of creative potential.

The class action project involves a process of selecting and planning topics and themes collecting references and materials, distributing tasks and articles, implementing learning and teaching strategies to assemble the whole work and integrating and editing the outcome. The survey shows that the publishing English Newspaper project results in facilitating learners' positive learning attitude and academic atmosphere as well as improving general English communicative abilities. The study discusses advantages of extensive use of hand-on templates of publishing newspapers and magazines not for limited language education only but for integrated project-based general learning and teaching.",0,0,Education & Educational Research

This paper explores the possible relationships between gifted educators' periodic debates and the philosophical war among advocates of differing perspectives of social science research. The authors discuss how the acceptance of a particular mode of inquiry embeds tacit ideas into the debate that make resolution difficult. The tacit assumptions of three modes of disciplined inquiry (empirical-analytic, interpretive, and transformative) are presented in conjunction with the accompanying reformulation and reconceptualization of issues (definition, identification, and curriculum) that occur with each mode of inquiry.",18,18,Education & Educational Research; Psychology

Transformationally gifted individuals seek positively to change the world at some level-in their own way, to make the world a better place. Transactional giftedness is giftedness that is based on exchange. It is tit-for-tat in nature. The individual is identified as gifted and then expects and is expected to do something in return. That something, for children, is typically high-level performance in academic coursework. Society also may expect that the individual later in life will continue to show high educational achievement.

Further, the increased availability of large-scale electronically accessible data sets is an untapped area of study. This interpretive study examined middle school students' understanding of statistical concepts involved in making a plan to collect data to answer a statistical question within a social issue context using data available on the internet. Student artifacts, researcher notes, and audio and video recordings from nine groups of 20 seventh-grade students in two gifted education pull-out classes at a suburban middle school were used to answer the study research questions. Data were analyzed using a priori codes from previously developed frameworks and by using an inductive approach to find themes. Three themes that emerged from data related to confirmation bias. Some middle school students held preconceptions about the social issues they chose to study that biased their statistical questions. This in turn influenced the sources of data students used to answer their questions. Confirmation bias is a serious issue that is exacerbated due to endless sources of data electronically available. We argue that this type of bias should be addressed early in students' educational experiences. Based on the findings from this study, we offer recommendations for future research and implications for statistics and data science education.",0,0,Mathematics

In the research, the gifted students consisted of 275 boys, 128 girls, and additional 80 girls who were admitted to the gifted programme through affirmative action (AA). To assess these young students' scientific thinking skills, also referred to as science practices, open-ended questions of case-based questionnaires were developed. The investigated scientific thinking skills were question posing, explanation, graphing, inquiry, and metacognition. Analysis of the students' responses revealed that gifted girls who entered the programmes through AA performed at the same level as the other gifted students. We found significant differences between the three research groups in question posing and graphing skills. We suggest increasing gender-fairness by revising the standard national testing system to include case-based narratives followed by open-ended questions that assess gifted students' scientific thinking skills. This may diminish the gender inequity expressed by the different number of girls and boys accepted to the gifted programmes. We show that open-ended tools for analysing students' scientific thinking might better serve both research and practice by identifying gifted girls and boys equally well.",4,4,Education & Educational Research

However, it is apparent from existing research that a wide range of methods have been adopted to study perfectionism in this population. To identify what is currently known about perfectionism among these students and what future work needs to be undertaken, a systematic review of existing research is required. The aim of our study was to provide a first such review. In doing so, we utilised the two-factor perfectionism model which differentiates between perfectionistic strivings (PS) and perfectionistic concerns (PC). A systematic literature search returned 36 studies examining perfectionism in young students identified as academically gifted that varied in study characteristics, methodological quality, and findings. Of these studies, 24 adopted a variable-based approach to examining perfectionism (i.e., examined PS and PC) and 12 adopted a group-based approach to examining perfectionism (i.e., examined groups with varying levels of PS and PC). The findings show that the distinction between PS and PC is extremely important. Specifically, while PC are likely to be uniformly debilitating for students who are academically gifted, PS are associated with more mixed outcomes. This is also the case when the two dimensions of perfectionism are considered in combination, with levels of PC being the key factor in determining the outcomes associated with perfectionism. Future research needs to build on the existing evidence base in a systematic fashion and prioritise longitudinal research and intervention studies.",3,3,Psychology

Spatial ability is considered an important indicator of potential talent in the domains of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). This study explored undergraduate students' spatial ability, focusing on mental rotation, by investigating the relationships of three variables with performance on a spatial ability test, in terms of test scores and test completion time. A three-way analysis of variance revealed statistically significant main effects of gifted program participation, choice of academic major, and gender, suggesting that students who participated in a gifted program, who majored in a STEM discipline, or who were male outperformed their counterparts on a measure of spatial ability when the other conditions were equivalent. No interaction effects existed among the three variables, indicating that none of them functioned as a moderator of students' performance on the spatial ability assessment. However, when spatial ability was considered as a mediating variable in a path model, gender had the largest total effect on the probability of students majoring in a STEM area. In addition, the more time students spent on the spatial ability test, the better they tended to perform, which is a finding inconsistent with current literature.",20,21,Education & Educational Research; Psychology

Nurturing these capacities may be especially effective for promoting giftedness in students who are likely to lose interest and ambition over time. Giftedness is frequently equated with high general intelligence as measured by IQ tests, but this narrow conceptualization does not adequately capture students' abilities to utilize their talents strategically to fully realize their future possible selves. The brain's default mode network is thought to play an important role in supporting imaginative thinking about the self and others across time. Because this network's functioning is temporarily attenuated when individuals engage in task-and action-oriented focus (mindsets thought to engage the brain's executive attention network), we suggest that consistently focusing students on tasks requiring immediate action could undermine long-term cultivation of giftedness. We argue that giftedness-especially in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)-can be cultivated by encouraging adolescents' intellectual curiosity and supporting their ability to connect schoolwork to a larger purpose. Improving STEM and gifted education may depend upon a shift from knowledge transmission and regimented evaluation to creative exploration, intentional reflectiveness, and mindful switching between task focus and imagining.",4,5,Psychology

In biomedicine, the gain and production of knowledge (the gift of knowledge) is often grounded in bodily gift (sacrifice) and donor practices. The latter are associated with a number of mishaps in the history of biomedicine, reflecting the violation of moral norms in the process of obtaining scientific data and demonstrating the need for a clear differentiation of intellectual and moral virtues. An important factor in the formation of the epistemic norms of modern biomedicine has been the transformation of the values of scientific knowledge from practices of coercion to giving. As a result, the involuntary sacrifice of biomaterials to science was replaced by voluntary practices of somatic giving and informational exchange that determine the process of mutual recognition in science. It is shown that gift-giving in science is closely associated with intellectual virtues, with intellectual generosity characterizing the idea of openness in science and scientists' intention for production and constant growth of knowledge, and can also be related to the idea of altruistic service to science, involving the exchange of received scientific data and access to free information in the network space. A number of examples of the modern digital gift ethos and the implementation of the principles of openness of knowledge and knowledge exchange in the context of the creation of biomedical expert digital platforms, the formation of social scientific networks - platforms with open access to scientific information, the development of the phenomenon of garage science and other zones of exchange experience are considered.",0,0,Philosophy

Affective domain has been considered as one of the pillar of giftedness although a limited number of studies have been carried out related to this issue and gifted students' attitude towards mathematics has rarely been investigated. The three-dimensional model of attitude towards mathematics (emotional dimension, perceived competence and vision of mathematics) developed by Zan and Di Martino (Montana Math Enthusiast 3:157-168, 2007) was used in order to better understand the factors affecting the construction of students' positive and negative attitudes. A total of 36 fifth grade (12years old) students in a centre for gifted students participated in the study. The data were gathered through students' metaphors about mathematics, students' narratives about their mathematical experiences and interviews with each student. The data were analysed using the content analysis method. The findings showed that the majority of the students had a positive attitude towards mathematics and that this attitude was quite stable and developed at an early age, although one-third of the students had negative or unstable attitude towards mathematics. The findings also indicated that there was a strong interaction between the three dimensions of attitude, and the vision of mathematics often underlies students' positive and negative emotions towards mathematics.",2,2,Education & Educational Research

To this end, a small group activity was conducted to measure the density of the earth, and 8 small groups were selected, including 4 co-ownership type and 4 monopolistics type groups with different communication structures. And then, the framework was developed for analyzing verbal interactions to compare the differences in characteristics between small groups. The results are as follows. First, regardless of the communication structures, there were showing a simple pingpong-type communication structures for all small groups. Second, negative interactions such as 'restraint', 'command', 'complaint', and 'lack of confidence' predominantly appeared in all small groups. Third, the students in the status of out-lookers in small groups were mainly verbal interactions, such as instructing the other person, acting against the other person's actions, and expressing dissatisfaction with the attitudes and abilities of members. Therefore, teachers should guide students to use higher-level verbal interactions in their group activities in small group activities, and engage in students communication to prevent negative interactions from occurring. The teachers also need to check the level of achievement for students in the status of out-lookers in advance and guide them to participate more actively in small group activities.

Based on the commitment signal hypothesis, we tested whether relational mobility, which was operationalized as divorce rate in Study 1 and relational opportunities in Study 2, is positively correlated with the frequency of gift exchanges among married couples. In Study 1, we found that married couples in the U.S., which is associated with a relatively high divorce rate, were more likely to give and receive gifts to and from their partners than those in Japan, which is associated with a relatively low divorce rate. This societal difference, in contrast, was not observed among unmarried couples, who were still developing their relationship (and thus, partner changes could frequently happen regardless of the country-level divorce rate). Study 2, a secondary analysis of extant survey data, revealed that Japanese married couples who have more relational opportunities more frequently engage in gift exchanges than those who do not.

I argue that gifted education needs a new foundation that provides a broad psychosocial basis than what the notion of giftedness can afford. A focus on talent development rather than giftedness should be based on a theory of talent development that is truly developmental, treating the developing person as an open, dynamic, and adaptive system, changing oneself adaptively while interacting with environmental opportunities and challenges. To introduce ECT, I first delineate the meaning and significance of four dimensions or parameters of talent development undergirding this new theory: domain, person, development, and culture. I then describe how ECT explicates the developmental processes and transitions as the result of human adaptations to environmental opportunities and challenges. More specifically, ECT uses the constructs of characteristic and maximal adaptation to elucidate how domain, person, development, and culture jointly shape a particular line of talent development, and how cognitive, affective, and social processes interact to push and sustain a critical transition from characteristic adaptation to maximal adaptation, eventually leading to high-caliber performance and creative productivity.

However, little is known about the potentially adverse consequences of alcohol gifting. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of, and factors associated with, alcohol gifting, and explore whether drinking and tobacco use were associated with alcohol gifting. Methods Using a cross-sectional multi-stage survey, a sample of 982 household heads from Guangdong Province and 530 household heads from Shaanxi Province was collected online from 30 April to 30 July 2020 in China. Participants completed questionnaires regarding socio-demographic characteristics, social capital, drinking status, and gifting alcohol behavior. Chi-square analysis and multiple logistic regression analysis were used to identify the factors associated with alcohol gifting, and to identify its relationship with alcohol and cigarette use status. Results Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that age, gender, household annual income, province, drinking status, and social participation were prominent correlates of both offering and receiving alcohol. Participants who were married, had an education level of junior high school, or had a large social network had higher odds of receiving alcohol. When both alcohol gifting behaviors were included in the models, participants who offered alcohol had 2.15 (95% CI: 1.63-2.85) times higher odds of current drinking than those who didn't offer alcohol and participants who received alcohol had 1.87 (95% CI: 1.45-2.41) times higher odds of current drinking than those who did not receive alcohol. Those who received alcohol had significantly higher odds of current smoking (AOR = 1.64; 95% CI: 1.25-2.14), while those who offered alcohol had significantly lower odds of current smoking (AOR = 0.71;95% CI:0.53-0.95). Conclusions Social participation is an important correlate of alcohol gifting. Alcohol receiving behaviors were significantly associated with both current alcohol and tobacco use. These associations can be used to inform alcohol gifting interventions in China.",0,0,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"

As the Chinese are increasingly aware of harm from smoking cigarettes, e cigarettes, often promoted as less harmful alternatives to cigarettes, may be viewed as appropriate gifts. This study is the first using population-based survey data to examine receiving and giving e-cigarettes as gifts in China. We analyzed 9,274 adults from Wave 5 of the International Tobacco Control China Survey, which was completed in July 2015. We found that the prevalence of receiving e-cigarettes as gifts was 1.3% among all respondents and 5.3% among urban smokers; the prevalence of giving e-cigarettes as gifts was 0.5% among all respondents and 1.2% among urban smokers. These prevalence estimates were very low among nonsmokers and rural respondents. Further analysis on urban smokers (N = 3,312) found that those aged 40-54 and 55+, those with high education levels, heavy smokers, and those who perceived e-cigarettes as equally/more harmful than cigarettes were more likely to receive e-cigarette gifts; and those who ever used e-cigarettes were significantly more likely to both receive and give e-cigarette gifts. Urban smokers with positive attitude about cigarette gifting were also more likely to give e-cigarette gifts to others, but those aged 55+ were less likely to gift e-cigarettes. Findings of this study indicate that the Chinese may perceive e-cigarettes as appropriate gifts for smokers, especially heavy smokers. Precautions should be taken to prevent e-cigarettes from becoming a gift choice for nonsmokers. Health campaigns designed to combat the social acceptance of cigarette gifting may also help reduce e-cigarette gifting.",2,2,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"

One hundred and sixty-five documents were analyzed, of which fifteen studies complied with the inclusion criteria. Seven of these made comparisons between gifted and non-gifted students, classified according to three perspectives: (a) studies concluding that gifted students have a greater risk of being victims than non-gifted students and have a lower risk of being a bully, due to the characteristics of this group; (b) studies that affirm that gifted students have a lower risk of being a bully or victim, as compared to non-gifted students since their high cognitive level allows them to effectively handle social and emotional challenges, thereby contributing to a lower level of participation in bullying or victimization behavior; (c) and studies concluding that gifted students have a similar risk of being a bully or victim as non-gifted students. Studies that only use samples of gifted students reveal a high prevalence of bullying and cyberbullying, and very negative consequences on this group. Although the limited number of studies does not allow for a definitive confirmation of a greater vulnerability to bullying by academically gifted students, it does confirm the need to recommend that the educational community offer preventive elements and specific interventions for this group.",0,0,Criminology & Penology; Psychology

Professional boundaries ensure that a dentist's focus remains on the patient's welfare. Such boundaries may be compromised by accepting gifts from patients. Methods. General dentists attending a continuing dental education conference completed an anonymous questionnaire about professional boundaries and acceptance of gifts from patients. The authors compared subjects' responses to questionnaire items and calculated descriptive statistics. Results. Of the 333 dentists attending the conference, 219 (65.8 percent) submitted a completed or partially completed survey. Of the respondents, 81.2 percent endorsed receiving gifts, 82.5 percent thought accepting inexpensive gifts was acceptable, 79.7 percent would accept a dinner invitation from a patient, 52.1 percent would accept a $1,000 discount from a business owned by a patient and 59.0 percent would fabricate a set of dentures in exchange for house-painting services. More than one-third of respondents stated they would not accept a gift worth $25 to $100, and 51.1 percent would not accept a gift worth more than $ 100. There were no statistically significant differences in responses stratified by sex, age and years in practice, with the exception that female dentists were significantly less likely to accept a dinner invitation. Logistic regression models revealed that younger dentists and dentists with fewer years in practice were less likely to respond agree or strongly agree to accepting gifts worth $25 to $100, and female dentists were less likely to respond agree. or strongly agree to accepting a dinner invitation. Conclusion. A majority of dentists endorsed accepting gifts from patients, which may put them at risk of violating boundaries with patients. Practice Implications.

The present study investigated whether, as in the native language (NL), the level of foreign language (FL) literacy of gifted students with dyslexia is higher than the literacy level of averagely intelligent students with dyslexia and whether this difference can be accounted for by the difference in their NL literacy level. The sample consisted of 148 Dutch native speaking secondary school students divided in four groups: dyslexia, gifted/dyslexia, typically developing (TD), and gifted. All students were assessed on word reading and orthographic knowledge in Dutch and English when they were in 7th or 8th grade.

Results showed that Dutch gifted students with dyslexia have higher NL literacy levels than averagely intelligent students with dyslexia. As in the NL, a stepwise pattern of group differences was found for English word reading and spelling, i.e., dyslexia < gifted/dyslexia < TD < gifted. However, it was not found for French and German literacy performance. These results point towards compensation: the higher English literacy levels of gifted/dyslexic students compared to their averagely intelligent dyslexic peers result from mechanisms that are unique to English as a FL.

Despite many efforts to improve science education in the laboratory, a cookbook style of verification experiments often dominate school science. In this study, we conducted an open laboratory activity that provided students with an opportunity to think about Newton's second law reflectively. Specifically, students were encouraged to conduct Newton's second law experiment in a way that was teacher-guided and then they used the same topic to design and conduct their own experiment. As a result, the students demonstrated their challenges in using various creative experimental methods. For example, some students installed a pulley and weight on both sides of a rail to keep the mass and friction coefficient of the cart constant because they thought the friction of the cart to be the main cause of errors. Other students investigated the bidirectional movement of the cart, finding ways to determine the friction and the small tilted angle of rail at the same time. Through the open laboratory activity conducted in this study, students seemed to show understanding of the nature of science.

Small differences between gifted boys and girls in achievements, interests, careers, and relationships can become exaggerated through gendered educational practices. Kindergarten red-shirting'' of boys and the denial of early admission to girls can cause gifted children to be out of step throughout their academic careers. When gifted children are not actively encouraged to participate in talent searches and after-school and summer programs, whether because of overprotection of girls or the insistence on athletic activities at the expense of academic activities for boys, they lose the opportunity for challenge, friendships, and community. When boys are not supported in their interests in creative careers and girls are not supported in their interests in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics careers, they may enter occupations that will not offer them the sense of purpose and meaning they might have otherwise had. It is in the area of gender relations, however, that long-term consequences of gendered practices are most apparent for gifted individuals because both gifted boys and girls need to plan for balancing family and career.

The results show that giftedness is seen as multidimensional, and both intrapersonal and environmental contributions are recognized as essential in talent development. The conceptions of gifted children were quite diverse, and gifted children's possible problems were frequently discussed. Moreover, misunderstandings were revealed as well as areas that have not been adequately addressed.",9,9,Education & Educational Research; Psychology

The plurality of studies published in the last decades in the field of giftedness, in particular with a focus on research and psychological intervention, emphasizes the existence of a difference of understanding regarding the concept of giftedness, the different forms of their identification, and also the respective intervention models. Research in the area of giftedness has revealed, in general terms, a lack of articulation between the definition of the construct and the practices in force in this area. Guided by the research question What are the antecedents and what are the practices of psychological intervention in giftedness?, The present study aims to know, interpret, critically appropriate and enumerate the fundamentals and identify the practices of psychological intervention with gifted students and with their families. The empirical part of this study stems from a systematic review of the literature, focused on psychological intervention in the last five years, in order to investigate the contributions of psychology to educational practices with gifted students. The study ensures: descriptive validity, interpretive validity, theoretical validity, and pragmatic validity. The research was carried out in the different sources of indexing according to the inclusion criteria and subsequently a reading filter was applied, namely a reading of the title, the summary and the keywords for each study. After the studies were submitted to the first previously defined reading filter, 68 studies were excluded from the 160 selected ones, and included 92 studies in the qualitative systematic review of the literature. The exclusion of the 68 studies was due to the existence of 38 duplicate studies and 30 excluded studies after the first reading filter was submitted, namely a reading of the title, summary and keywords in the various predefined indexing sources and since they did not meet the previously defined criteria. An analysis of 92 was performed with the help of two data analysis software. After analyzing the quantitative data, it should be noted that 2014 and 2015 are the years that present a greater number of publications regarding educational practices with gifted, and since 2015 there is a decrease in the number of publications, and 30 studies are indexed by the Web of Science, ten by ELSEVIER Scopus, 35 by Scielo, 14 by Pepsic and three by B-on. Regarding the analysis of qualitative data, the studies were grouped into three categories: dimensions of giftedness; signaling and intervention; and legislation. Thus, the results of the three categories indicate that there are more studies in the last five years alluding to the first category, specifically the dimensions of giftedness compared to the categories of signaling and intervention and legislation. The systematization of future implications and suggestions for research and for psychological intervention in educational contexts with gifted students and their families is carried out.",0,0,Education & Educational Research; Psychology

The comparative analysis confirmed the inconsistency of the structure of training of specialists of Ukraine not only with the similar structure in developed countries but even with the structure of countries with the appropriate level of economic development. To solve mentioned problem on the basis of the study, the article presents: the structure of systemic interaction of the activities of higher education institutions and the structure of their funding with the involvement of institutional and extra-budgetary sources; proposed normative-legal, organizational, financial measures aimed at increasing the quality of education, which would correspond to the level of the world's leading countries. Activities include specific recommendations, such as encouraging students to do research using a sub-project approach with separate terms of reference and budget; non-financial involvement of students in the research projects of leading scientists as a tool to stimulate the acquisition of new skills and knowledge, the rating approach - the best student - the best researcher, etc. Using the methods of mathematical formalization, a forecast of the deterioration of the quality indicator of mathematical and natural education was formed, which became the justification for the urgency of educational reforms; the existence of correlation of nominal GDP per capita from the indicator of the quality of mathematical and natural education is proved and the values of time intervals necessary for the manifestation of this dependence are established.

This study argues that there is need for a paradigm shift in the identification process that predominantly uses psychometric measurements in the portfolio that captures the actual data points of gifted children. This is particularly relevant for developing countries like India, which has a diverse population predominantly from disadvantaged communities. Establishing norms for standardized psychometric tests developed for the western populations will have inherent limitations to identifying the gifted children in multi-lingual and multi-cultural contexts.

For this aim, the research has been carried out with 70 gifted students (35 in the experimental group and 35 in the control group) studying in the Recognizing Individual Skills 1 program at a Science and Art Center. A 6-week implementation has been carried out taking into account the lesson plans developed by the flipped classroom model for the experimental group and the existing Recognizing Individual Skills Program 1 curriculum for the control group. MANOVA has been used to analyze the quantitative data, inductive content analysis was used to analyze the qualitative data. A statistically significant difference has been found between the experimental and control groups in favor of the experimental group in terms of academic achievement and self-regulation skill scores during the quantitative data analysis. However, while we were able to generalize to the accessible population the results found in terms of academic achievement, we could not generalize the results to the population in terms of self-regulation. As a result of the qualitative data analysis, students stated the model to be effective for learning and flexible in terms of content and time, to assure that they come prepared for the course, and to increase their self-regulation skills. In this context, the flipped classroom model is recommended for use in the subject of science for gifted students",0,0,Education & Educational Research

Although in its infancy, trepidations, reluctance and apprehension have been the responses to robots taking over humans. In the case of education of brain-impaired children, the parents and teachers of these gifted human beings, the introduction of humanoids for social skills training have been met with the same perceptions. The findings were derived from the qualitative analysis and case study that was conducted at a special-education primary school located in Shah Alam, Selangor, Malaysia. Through interviews with the teachers at the special-education classes, they are of the opinion that the gifted children still need a fellow human being to look up to rather than a big toy. Physically, the teachers look different and the children are able to attach a name to their teachers unlike robots that look the same anywhere. They opined that the human touch far exceeds that of robots, no matter how close the physical resemblance the robots are to a human being. Moreover, the cultural and religious elements exceed the robot's capability in skilling and preparing these special-needs children for their adult life and independence. Also, the emotional and spiritual aspects cannot be replaced by robots. Hence, the findings evidenced an intense emphasis on cultural and religious values for these students with similar implications. No matter the positive reports on the use of robots in developed nations, cultural mores, tradition, ethics and the Islamic faith are more important to these gifted children than modern technology.

The findings from a survey by questionnaire conducted by the authors revealed that in organizing their work with gifted children most pedagogues tend to rely on the exchange of experience with their colleagues (64.1 %) and reflection about their own pedagogical experience (38.5 %). It was found that 48.2 % tend to gain relevant knowledge through reading scholarly and instructional literature, and 33.3 % tend to do so through taking advanced training courses. Only 15.4 % of respondents were found to invoke pedagogical conceptualization of literary works and films about gifted children. At the same time, 70 % of respondents were found to believe that watching and conducting pedagogical analysis of films about gifted children can be of help to the pedagogue in building interaction with the gifted child. The paper explores the potential of motion pictures as a non-traditional form of pedagogical information relating to working with gifted children, which implies the possibility of invoking scholarly conceptualization of films with the aim of resolving the kind of objectives for working with gifted children for which there have yet to be produced scientifically rational pedagogical solutions and which require invoking pedagogical knowledge that content-wise is not scientifically conceptual and form-wise is not present in scholarly texts but is capable of functioning as a possible solution to achieve them. The work highlights the following key objectives: adjusting one's professional position in working with gifted children; adapting scholarly-theoretical knowledge on pedagogy and psychology to the individual characteristics of and the specific conditions of teaching and educating gifted children; making moral assessments of one's pedagogical actions in respect of gifted children; seeking to overcome difficulties in understanding and conceptualizing scholarly-theoretical knowledge; seeking to resolve various psychological issues (e.g., fears and anxiety, emotional exhaustion and frustration, psychological trauma, and animus toward a particular gifted child); seeking to resolve difficulties in engaging in reflection about one's pedagogical actions. The authors employed problem analysis and expert assessment to select 12 domestic and foreign motion pictures that address relevant issues in working with gifted children and look at problems and difficulties that gifted children may experience. Only less than a third of the respondents were found to be familiar with these movies (2.6 to 35.9 %). The exception is the film 'Scarecrow'. This may be associated with the fact that the launch of this movie was a significant event for the majority of Russians. The rest of the films, both Russian and foreign, which focus on equally important issues in working with gifted children, were found to have been overlooked by the participating pedagogues (e.g. , 'The Jester', 'Schedule for the Day After Tomorrow', 'When I Will Become a Giant' (Russia), 'Gifted', 'Little Man Tate' (USA), 'Billy Elliot' (UK), 'Vitus' (Switzerland), 'The Little Prince' (France and Italy), and 'Little Stars on Earth' (India)). The findings suggest the need to engage future and practicing teachers in purposeful work involving the scholarly-pedagogical conceptualization of motion pictures and works of literature about gifted children and their problems in school and the mastering of relevant techniques for employing the results of such conceptualization in working with gifted children. The paper highlights the following key aspects of organizing this kind of work: criteria for selecting movies, methods for individual analysis of movies, organization of group discussions, and creation of collections of films focusing on various issues in working with gifted children. The insights from the research reported in this paper can be used by higher education institutions focused on the training of future pedagogues, curriculum developers in institutions of general learning and supplementary learning for children, and pedagogues working with gifted children.",1,1,Education & Educational Research

The 2 x 2 x 2 research design that was used examined the effects of giftedness (i.e., gifted vs. non-gifted), instruction-type (i.e., problem-solving vs. worked examples), and structure (i.e., high vs low contrast materials) on the learning outcomes of transfer and procedural knowledge. The study also examined the impact of explicit instruction and invention-first instruction strategies on non-performance variables-self-efficacy, extraneous load, experience of knowledge gaps, and interest. The results of the study suggested that invention-first instruction may be more effective than example-first instruction in transfer, and that gifted students may benefit more from invention-first instruction than example-first instruction. The use of contrast materials was not found to affect performance. Furthermore, instruction was found to have no significant effects on the investigated non-performance variables.

If, as has been proposed recently, nuptial gifts represent sensory traps, males will be selected to produce gifts that are attractive to females but such gifts will not necessarily provide the female with nutritional benefits (the 'Candymaker' hypothesis). We examined the free amino acid content of the spermatophylax of the cricket Gryllodes sigillatus (Orthoptera: Gryllidae) using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The spermatophylax (dry weight) consisted of approximately 7 per cent free amino acids. The free amino acid composition was highly imbalanced, with a low proportion of essential amino acids (18.7%) and a high proportion of proline and glycine. The main free amino acids found in the spermatophylax appeared to act as phagostimulants: the duration of feeding on artificial gels by females was positively related to the free amino acid content of the gels. The results therefore suggest that males use free amino acids to 'sweeten' a relatively low-value food item.

The differences in psychological well-being indicators for adolescents with different levels of verbal creativity were identified: in particular, adolescents with high creativity have a lower indicator of positive relationships with others. The structure of correlations between psychological well-being and creativity in groups of adolescents with high and low creativity differs. Highly creative gifted teenagers tend to evaluate their condition as less favourable as compared to their peers with low creativity and struggle with establishing close relationships. Adolescents with low creativity are more satisfied with such characteristics of educational environment as relationships with others and opportunities provided by the environment.

A group of German primary school children (N = 24), identified earlier as intellectually gifted and selected to join the ET program was compared to a gender-, class-and IQ-matched group of control children that did not participate in this program. All participants performed the Standard Progressive Matrices (SPM) test, which measures intelligence in well-defined problem space; the Creative Reasoning Task (CRT), which measures intelligence in ill-defined problem space; and the test of creative thinking-drawing production (TCT-DP), which measures creativity, also in ill-defined problem space. Results revealed that problem space matters: the ET program is effective only for the improvement of intelligence operating in well-defined problem space. An effect was found for intelligence as measured by SPM only, but neither for intelligence operating in ill-defined problem space (CRT) nor for creativity (TCT-DP). This suggests that, depending on the type of problem spaces presented, different cognitive abilities are elicited in the same child. Therefore, enrichment programs for gifted, but also for children attending traditional schools, should provide opportunities to develop cognitive abilities related to intelligence, operating in both well-and ill-defined problem spaces, and to creativity in a parallel, using an interactive approach.",5,5,Psychology

The study considers giftedness as a complex system of abilities and analyzes approaches to the study of giftedness in accordance with the teaching of linguistic disciplines. Linguistics as a discipline studies various aspects of language and is closely related to the system of sciences, the study of which is necessary for the formation of students' giftedness and the level of their worldview. In the course of the study, both qualitative (the dynamics of changes in the proportion of students participating in additional educational programs for children in 2015-19 in relation to their total number) and quantitative (the dynamics of changes in the total number of students participating in additional educational programs for children in 2015-19 and thoroughly studying certain areas in 2019) were collected.

We argue that our understanding of gift-giving in humans can be enhanced by examining animal models as long as the model-species shares the appropriate behavior: monogamy. Thus, the gibbon might be a more appropriate model. Monogamy encourages pairs to expend effort in mate-retention. In Study 1 (N = 120), we show that gift-giving in courtship is localized to long-term mates: most strongly in men. In Study 2 (N = 100), we demonstrate that gift-giving is a tactic used by men to both court and retain mates: most commonly for retention. In line with traditional models of helping, women planned to provide gifts to friends and family more than men.

The problem statement of this research is What is the power of self-esteem, parental attitudes and peer relationships in predicting gifted students' psychological resilience? Method: Correlational survey method was used in the research. The study group consisted of a total of 219 students (6th, 7th, 8th, 9th grade and high school preparatory class students) attending three separate Science and Art Centers. Data were collected by Adolescent Psychological Resilience Scale, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale-Short Form, Parenting Style Scale and Friendship Qualities Scale. Multiple regression analysis was used to analyze the data. Findings: The results of the study revealed that the acceptance / involvement and psychological autonomy support received from parents, self-esteem and peer relations variables significantly predicted the psychological resilience levels of gifted students, while parents' control / strictness behaviors did not significantly predict. It was seen that acceptance/involvement received from parents was the strongest variable predicting the resilience of gifted students. Discussion: Findings obtained from the study show that self-esteem, family and friend relationships have an important power in explaining the resilience of gifted students. However, research results revealed that external protective factors such as acceptance/involvement received from parents and peer relationships explain the resilience levels of gifted students more strongly.

The purpose of this article is to persuade gifted education researchers and practitioners to reincorporate modern human intelligence theory (as expressed in Cattell-Horn-Carroll, or CHC, theory) and research into their work on gifted children. There are five reasons to make intelligence part of gifted education research: (a) intelligence is one of the best studied constructs in psychology; (b) educators know more about how to adjust educational plans in response to intelligence than many other traits; (c) grounding research in CHC theory strengthens the links between gifted education and psychology, making gifted education more relevant to outsiders; (d) intelligence is an excellent predictor of long-term general life outcomes; and (e) many issues in gifted education (such as curriculum planning and underidentification) are best understood if considered in relation to intelligence and related cognitive abilities.

This paper extends this list by adding two sub-processes that are imported from the literature on experts and novices: namely, Retrieval and Goal Directness. Based on these five sub-processes in conjunction with the concept of selectivity as an ordinal (rather than dichotomous) dimension, we have constructed a model that is being used for the analysis of the solution processes of gifted and average students, as reflected in their post solution protocols. Middle high school students (gifted and average) solved insight problems, without and with analogical learning, and were asked to report on the solution process they undertook. The suggested model was found to be an effective instrument for analyzing the sub-processes employed during problem solving. Though both the gifted and the average were able to arrive at correct solutions, the study shows that they employed different sub-processes in doing so. The model can serve as a fine-grade analysis of solution processes among various populations (gifted/average and possibly experts/novices) that will be helpful in research and teaching.

Fifteen-year-old students from 13 European countries were selected for this data-set (normative=79,550, gifted=1956). Student's scores on the four scales were tested for significant differences with students from that same country. Tests revealed no significant differences for 55% of the comparisons, 40% of comparisons had positive effect sizes for gifted students, and 4% had negative effect sizes. The evidence presented in this study supports the existence of harmony theory. More specifically, the vast majority of gifted students in this study reported equal or higher level of belonging. Contained within the findings in this study on students' to the sense of belonging is a lack of evidence of gifted students reporting higher levels of loneliness. These findings strongly reflect the Terman's assertion almost a century ago stating the lack of gifted children tending to be more socially maladjusted.",11,11,Education & Educational Research; Psychology

The academic fields of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM), in particular, are in need of a better understanding of their major donors. This article analyzes a unique database of announced gifts to higher education institutions from 1995 to 2017 to investigate relationships between major donors' characteristics and the magnitude of their gifts to STEM and all other academic disciplines. Major donors to STEM are disproportionately entrepreneurs who, on average, give larger gifts to STEM than other major donors. Quantile regressions reveal a positive and statistically significant relationship between major donors' entrepreneurial status and gift amounts at the 99th quantile (worth US$100 million or more). As major funding sources for academic STEM are increasingly threatened, these findings are pertinent to academic institutions seeking to leverage major donors as an alternative source of funding.",3,3,Social Issues

Most of them get lower marks than their talent allows them to get. One of the reasons is that strictly regulated learning process developed for an average students doesn't correspond to the tempo of intellectual abilities development of a gifted one. That leads to dissatisfaction and estrangement of students who don't get tasks according to their intellectual level and they work without revealing their whole potential. From the point of view the Institute of Gifted Child (IGC) of the National Academy of Pedagogical Sciences of Ukraine one of the ways to solve this problem is to create a stimulating intellectual medium, enriched with interactive programmes of gift development, which give an opportunity to communicate through virtual path. These programmes are developed by specialists who have huge experience in organizing of research activity in the learning process. We have also engaged outstanding scientists, inventors, honoured teachers, winners of professional contests from all over Ukraine. It was established that in the secondary school age the gift gets subject direction. One of its main characteristics is the domination of motives connected with the contents of studying (orientation to new knowledge and ways of its acquirement) and organization of the learning process itself. In order to enrich the content of gifted students education in Ukraine there were implemented interactive intersubject researching programmes-contests, supported by IGC: Kolosok from natural science disciplines, Levenya- physics competition, Leleka - science history competition, Ukrainian interactive competition of young inventors Technician-junior and research programme My Planet Earth. The peculiarities of these programmes are the following: any secondary school student of 3-8 grade has an opportunity to participate, children do information searching and research work by their own, students do information searching on tasks received from organizing committee 2.5-3 months before the contests, there is also parents' involvement etc. The participants of these programmes can do their researching in summer schools where they continue to form their research skills. For the further support of students' research works there is an out-of-school educational establishment Minor Academy of Sciences of Ukraine. Its goal is to develop students' scientific creativity. As a rule, high school students who are motivated to scientific search are involved in Minor Academy of Sciences of Ukraine work. IGC develops its own programmes of high school pupils' research activity support which are being implemented using IT on learning co-operation support server called Minor Academy of Sciences of Ukraine Virtual School. We've successfully launched and tested the Virtual school of invention and Virtual school of young researcher and have developed some other interdisciplinary projects. The main goal of these programmes is the formation of basic creative skills, psychological support of gifted individuals and satisfaction of their intellectual needs. The approaches given above have proved their efficiency as to providing the motivation and operational support of the research activity of intellectually gifted students and giving an opportunity to realize their academic potential.",1,1,Education & Educational Research

In addition, through in-depth interviews, the perceptions of gifted students was accurately investigated. As a result of this study, the content of science classes and instructors showed high class satisfaction, but the smart devices and applications used during the science classes showed lower class satisfaction than others. As a result of comparing and analyzing the pre-post of gifted students, interest in science class, attitude toward science inquiry, and professional interest in science increased significantly among the sub-areas of the scientific attitude test. As a result of analyzing free responses and in-depth interviews, gifted students responded with the advantage that classes using smart devices that combine AR and VR can be tested quickly and safely for a short time compared to actual experiments. On the other hand, they responded with low completeness of the application and dizziness when operating virtual reality. Based on this, implications for the development of applications and instructional programs using advanced technologies that can experience realistically limited scientific experiments such as experimental preparation, class time, and risk factors were obtained.",0,0,Chemistry

This was investigated in a British 14-year comparative study. Children labelled as gifted were found to be from different home backgrounds and to have different emotional profiles than others of the same measured ability who had not been seen as gifted. From this and other research it can be seen that expectations of highly able children can be confusing, for example that they either have poor social relationships or are natural social leaders. Teachers and parents may over-pressure pupils to excel at all times, or raise their all-round expectations for a child, even though s/he is only gifted in a specific area. Stress may also come from always having to learn at an unstimulating level, producing boredom, apathy and underachievement.

Methodological issues color the research findings. The ethical and pragmatic implications of developing research and policy are discussed. The conclusions are that there is a dearth of recent empirical research specifically related to ability grouping in science, and that the time is ripe for the concerted development of a research agenda by key players in science education reform. Moreover, as controversial and value-laden as the topic is, it should be noted that grouping practices alone are unlikely to influence science education reform unless considered in the context of comprehensive restructuring efforts at the local school level.",2,2,Education & Educational Research

The current study was conducted in line with the explanatory sequential mixed-methods design. The study group of the current research was comprised of 51 gifted students (26 in the control group and 25 in the experimental group) attending a Science and Arts Centre (BILSEM). In the application process, the astronomy teaching activities supported with AR were used in the experimental group while the astronomy teaching activities suggested in the official science curriculum of the middle school 7th grade were used. The data of the study were collected by using an Astronomy Achievement Test and the Scale of Interest in Astronomy as a pretest and posttest and an AR Interview form administered only to the experimental group students at the end of the application. The statistical analyses of the quantitative data revealed that before the experimental application, the experimental and control groups were equal in terms of astronomy achievement and interest in astronomy. After the completion of the application, however, significant differences were found for both the experimental and control groups in favor of the posttest. Moreover, significant differences were also found in the posttest in favor of the experimental group in terms of both astronomy achievement and interest in astronomy. In other words, AR-supported astronomy teaching activities positively affected the experimental group students' astronomy achievement and interest in astronomy. Furthermore, the experimental group students expressed many positive opinions about the AR applications within the categories of technical features and cognitive and affective features. The experimental group students wanted the use of AR applications in the teaching of other science subjects and other courses.",9,9,Education & Educational Research

In this study, we aimed to explore the intersections of general intelligence, creativity, and wisdom among sample of gifted adolescent students in Iran. In the academic year of 2019-2020, 532 talented male secondary students aged 15 to 18 studying in private high schools were selected using a purposive sampling method. In total, 70 students who scored 120 or more on the Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices, were recognized as gifted and asked to complete the Abedi-Schumacher Creativity Test and the Three-Dimensional Wisdom Scale. The results indicated that there is a positive and significant correlation between creativity and wisdom (r = .53, p < .001). However, the correlation between general intelligence and wisdom (r = .15, p = .05), and the correlation between general intelligence and creativity (r = .17, p = .05) did not turn out to be meaningful. With regard to the links between creativity and wisdom, it could be concluded that creativity and its development have an important role in the development of wisdom leading to a successful and satisfying life.

Although body donation to medical science contributes substantially to the quality of medical education, the ceremony was only the first time that the RUNMC publicly reciprocated the anatomical gift. By means of the monument the department of Anatomy endeavors to express gratitude for the gift of body donors and raise awareness among students to value the gift and treat donor bodies with the proper respect. Furthermore, the large attendance of bereaved at the unveiling ceremony, revealed another equally important meaning of the monument, which is the significance of the monument to the donor kin. The wish of a body donor has large implications for the way bereaved can take leave of the donor; there is limited time to bade the deceased farewell, the body will not be available for a funeral, and the donor kin stay behind empty handed without even a grave or ashes. Therefore the monument can be meaningful by facilitating the bereaved with a place of commemoration. The design of the monument anticipates on these multiple meanings and symbolisms by placing an old marble dissection table in the shape of an altar and fixing a bronze sculpture of a phoenix as symbol of imperishableness.

In this regard the big relevance is acquired by the humanitarian approach in the school education promoting familiarizing the school students with culture. The methodological basis of the research is connected with the ideas and principles of the formation of linguistically gifted school students' humanitarian culture (HC) in the system of additional foreignlanguage education (AFLE). The important part is also assigned to the methods of the system analysis, mathematical and evident modeling, the experimental and statistical methods in the course of carrying out the skilled and experimental work directed to the formation of HC in this category of the pupils. The purpose of the article is to analyze the results of the skilled and experimental work which helped to draw us a further conclusion that the technology of the formation of linguistically gifted school students' HC suggested by us in the course of teaching them a foreign language (FL) and the developed technologies are effective.

This paper provides a detailed analysis of GIFT-64 against differential and linear attacks. Our work complements automatic search methods for the best differential and linear characteristics with a careful manual analysis. This hybrid approach leads to new insights. In the differential setting, we theoretically explain the existence of differential characteristics with two active S-boxes per round and derive some novel properties of these characteristics. Furthermore, we prove that all optimal differential characteristics of GIFT-64 covering more than seven rounds must activate two S-boxes per round. We can construct all optimal characteristics by hand. In parallel to the work in the differential setting, we conduct a similar analysis in the linear setting. However, unlike the clear view in differential setting, the optimal linear characteristics of GIFT-64 must have at least one round activating only one S-box. Moreover, with the assistance of automatic searching methods, we identify 24 GIFT-64 variants achieving better resistance against differential attack while maintaining a similar security level against a linear attack. Since the new variants strengthen GIFT-64 against statistical cryptanalysis, we claim that the number of rounds could be reduced from 28 to 26 for the variants. This observation enables us to create a cipher with lower energy consumption than GIFT-64. Similarly to the case in GIFT-64, we do not claim any related-key security for the round-reduced variant as this is not relevant for most applications.",0,0,Computer Science; Mathematics

The paper is focused on understanding what concept of excellence such education policies imply; we aim to analyse the targeted groups with respect to means of identification and development, and to analyse the wider implications of such policies. The analysis is empirically focused on education policy documents on gifted and talented educational provisions at national/state level. Beginning with the political discourse of talent development in education as it has appeared in Denmark, we analyse this in relation to the policies and curricular provisions for the gifted and talented in England and Australia.",2,2,Education & Educational Research

We sought to examine the indicators of metacognitive behavior by means of eye-tracking technology and to compare these findings with the participants' subjective confidence ratings. Eye-movement data of gifted and average students attending final grades of primary school (4th and 5th grades) were recorded while they dealt with a deductive reasoning task, and four metrics supposed to bear on metacognitive skills, namely the overall trial duration, mean fixation duration, number of regressions and normalized gaze transition entropy, were analyzed. No significant differences between gifted and average children were found in the normalized gaze transition entropy, in mean fixation duration, nor - after controlling for the trial duration in number of regressions.

On whose authority should organs as a gift-of-life be donated? There are no universal answers to these questions; instead, responses must be compatible with local cultural values. This paper argues that from a Confucian point of view, organs should be viewed as a gift from the donor's family, and that final dispositional authority should also rest with the donor's family. The worth of such a gift rests on the virtue of ren, the origin of which is family love.

We investigated a motivational explanation for this difference, which states that starting with a practice problem might be too difficult, causing learners to lose confidence and motivation to study. We investigated this by presenting gifted (n=61) and nongifted primary school students (n=65) with two problem-example or example-problem pairs. We hypothesized that gifted students, who generally report higher perceived competence and autonomy and higher need for cognition, would be less affected by the difficulty of starting with a problem. As expected, gifted students indeed reported higher motivation and confidence than nongifted students, and gifted students were more efficient learners.

For high-achieving students, appropriate uses of perfectionistic self-regulation in academic settings were beneficial for their achievement. However, those students had a higher risk of depression when they lost control over their academic plans and behaviors, overwhelmed by their perfectionistic beliefs and excessive self-evaluations. The findings can be applied to the guidance and counseling for gifted students and underachieving students.",0,1,Education & Educational Research

Determining their modeling competencies and identifying the stages that they need to develop will provide essential data in terms of deciding on what kind of educational practices and program differentiation will be carried out. The study aims to develop a scale for mathematical modeling competencies and to determine its psychometric properties. Method: This is a descriptive study which was carried out with the participation of gifted students in two different groups. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was performed on the data obtained from 301 participants in the first group, and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was performed on the data obtained from 185 participants in the second group. Findings: The scale includes items to be rated on a level of agreement including Strongly agree, Agree, Moderately agree, Disagree and Strongly disagree, and there are no items that need reverse coding. The sub-factors of the scale were determined as 'identifying the real-life problem', 'understanding and simplifying the problem', 'mathematizing', 'working mathematically' and 'interpretation and validation'. Cronbach's alpha internal consistency coefficients were calculated as 0.958 for the scale and .811, .900, .883, .820 and .927 for the sub-factors, respectively. Fit indices of the scale (chi(2) / df = 2.00, GFI = .90, RMSEA = .075, SRMR = .063, IFI = .97, NNFI = .97, CFI = .97, NFI = .94, PNFI = .86) determined. Discussion: The developed scale is a 5-point Likert-type scale and there are no items that need to be reverse coded. According to the findings obtained from the analysis, it was concluded that the 31-item scale with a 5-factor structure is a valid and reliable scale. As a result of the research, it was concluded that the 31-item scale with a five-factor structure had sufficient psychometric properties to be used in future studies. The scale helps to measure both as a whole in the modeling process and partially in its stages. In this context, the scale developed within the scope of this research can be used for determining the stages that students are best at and those that require improvement.",0,0,Education & Educational Research

But some male animals invest in nuptial gifts that gains them access to females. Both these reproductive strategies are costly in that resources are needed to produce the weapon or nuptial gift. In closely related species where both weapons and nuptial gifts are present, little is known about the potential evolutionary trade-off faced by males that have these traits. In this study, we use dobsonflies (order Megaloptera, family Corydalidae, subfamily Corydalinae) to examine the presence and absence of enlarged male weapons versus nuptial gifts within and among species. Many dobsonfly species are sexually dimorphic, and males possess extremely enlarged mandibles that they use in battles, whereas in other species, males produce large nuptial gifts that increase female fecundity. In our study, we show that male accessory gland size strongly correlates with nuptial gift size and that when male weapons are large, nuptial gifts are small and vice versa. We mapped weapons and nuptial gifts onto a phylogeny we constructed of 57 species of dobsonflies. Our among-species comparison shows that large nuptial gift production evolved in many species of dobsonfly but is absent from those with exaggerated weapons. This pattern supports the potential explanation that the trade-off in resource allocation between weapons and nuptial gifts is important in driving the diversity of male mating strategies seen in the dobsonflies, whereas reduced male-male competition in the species producing large spermatophores could be an alternative explanation on their loss of male weapons. Our results shed new light on the evolutionary interplay of multiple sexually selected traits in animals.",31,31,Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology

Employing a pretest-training-post-test control group design, participants were split into four subgroups: gifted dynamic testing (n = 24), gifted control (n = 26), average-ability dynamic testing (n = 48) and average-ability control (n = 50). The results revealed that children who were dynamically tested progressed more in accuracy from pre-test to post-test than their peers who received practice opportunities only. Gifted children outperformed their average-ability peers in accuracy, but showed similar levels of improvement after training or practice only. Moreover, gifted children showed they needed fewer prompts during training than their average-ability peers.

These items are then carefully piloted in all countries before a final test is constructed. The studies in education need a large number of items assessing students' skills in different areas. Laboratory of Thinking - Diagnosis of Science Education in Poland has been carried out by the Science Section, Educational Research Institute, Warsaw, Poland. Its aim was to examine the level of skills and scientific knowledge of the ISCED2 level graduates in the four subsequent years. Assessment tools for the study were prepared during workshops organized by the Institute of Philosophy and Sociology, Polish Academy of Sciences and Educational Research Institute. Both type of items - the cognitive ones (in biology, chemistry, physics and geography) as well as contextual ones (for the students' questionnaire) were prepared according to the modified procedures used in the PISA study. As in PISA, the items preparing process involved multiple reviews by academic specialists and a field trials performed on random samples of student, as well as cognitive interviews (verbal probing technique). The main purpose of the publication is to describe how to use the cognitive interview technique in the items preparation process. Interviews using verbal probe technique were performed on selected students in order to track the possible reasons for items inconsistencies and students misconceptions. Students interviewed for each study were ISCED2 seniors (normally aged 15-16) and were familiar with all of the content covered by the items. They came from different schools, and were selected by their teachers to fit in one of the three categories: gifted but not diligent, gifted and diligent, and not gifted but diligent. In that sort of study it is essential that the students should be communicative, and this is also why the selection had to be made by their teachers, who knew them best. Each interview lasted for ca. 1.5 h and was recorded. To begin with, the student solved a test of several close-ended questions in science subjects, including the four described in the present paper. To complete this task, the student had as much time as he or she needed and additionally could write down a commentary to each of the items. Then he or she was asked questions about the school subjects they preferred and the reason behind it. For each of the items general and item-specific questions were asked.

Students either attended regular classes or special classes for the gifted (i.e., full-time ability grouping). Comparing boredom development across class types, we found only limited evidence for benefits of special classes for the gifted regarding the development of boredom. Rather, boredom increased in both class types over time. Despite other favorable effects of special classes for the gifted, tackling boredom does not seem to be one of them. Direct boredom prevention deserves increased attention throughout secondary school independent of class-type. Ability grouping provides an advanced learning environment for gifted students, possibly buffering them from common long-term increases in academic boredom. We present a 3.5-year longitudinal investigation, spanning four waves of measurement, featuring secondary school students (Grades 5 through 8) from five different German schools with full-time ability grouping (N = 1,861; 55.4% male). We used propensity score matching and latent growth curve modeling to determine the effects of class type on three types of boredom (intensity of boredom, boredom due to underchallenge, boredom due to overchallenge) in two subject domains (mathematics and German). We separated the effects of intervention effectiveness and efficacy, analyzing full and matched sample data. All types of boredom increased over time in both subjects.

An administrator is appointed to manage the land on behalf of other heirs and this practice poses risk as the administrator may fail to execute the trust. Hence, inter vivos gift is proposed to address this problem.

After observation, they were asked to generate a scientific hypothesis-a tentative causal explanation for the questions evoked. The results of this study revealed several distinguishing brain activities between gifted and normal children during hypothesis generation. In contrast to normal children, gifted children showed increased A-CMI values between the left temporal and central, between the left temporal and parietal, and between the left central and parietal locations while generating a hypothesis. These results suggested that gifted children more efficiently distribute the cognitive resources essential to cope with hypothesis generation. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The scorpionflies are considered as ideal model animals for the study of mating systems in insects. The males generally offer both prey and salivary mass as nuptial gifts to the females during copulation. Our field observations show that Panorpa liui is peculiar because the males offer only prey rather than salivary secretions as nuptial gift. Through anatomical and histological examinations, the salivary glands of P. liui were found to be devoid of sexual dimorphism in Panorpa for the first time. Both the male and female P. liui bear simple salivary glands, which are only composed of a common duct and two short sac-like glands. This is the first attempt to explore the relationship between the salivary glands and the mating tactics from the structural aspect in Panorpa, speculating that the simple structure of the male salivary glands in P. liui might be responsible for its failing to produce salivary mass as a nuptial gift during copulation. Compared with Boreidae, Meropidae, Bittacidae and Panorpidae, we presume that the absence of sexual dimorphism of the salivary glands might represent a plesiomorphy in P. liui.

However, most existing computer programming instruction mainly focuses on the training of programming language syntax and programming skills, while the problem-solving concepts are often ignored. Thus, in this study, an integrated Scratch and project-based learning approach is proposed to embed problem-solving scenarios in programming learning tasks. To test the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a total of 91 secondary school students, including 43 average students and 48 mathematics gifted students, participated in a project-based learning activity. The experimental results showed that the proposed learning approach could be fitted to all types of students. However, the mathematics gifted students outperformed the average students in terms of problem-solving performance, learning attitude and learning motivation. Furthermore, both average and mathematics gifted students showed significant progress after the learning activity, implying that the proposed approach benefited all of the students, no matter whether they tended to be gifted in mathematics or not.",13,13,Computer Science; Engineering

The article deals with the problem of identifying the resources of teachers - form tutors, focused on working with gifted students. This problem is considered in the context of the methodological shift from the classical to the post-non-classical scientific paradigm, from the deficit model to the model of success and resilience (S. Maddi, Ph. Hiver). A review of modern research on the problems of professiogenesis of form tutors is carried out. Aim. The aim of the present research was to empirically test the possibilities of a resource approach to the study of personal and existential-psychological aspects of the activities of teachers working with gifted children. Methodology and research methods. The methodological framework of the research is based on the provisions of the subject-activity, existential-psychological approaches to the development of the personality, to its being formation. Based on the analysis of the literature, personality traits (professional consciousness, creativity, a picture of the world, ego-identity, resilience, and others) are identified. These personality characteristics can be considered as the resources for professional development of teachers - form tutors. The severity of various types of reflection and their ratio are determined on the basis of a differential reflexivity questionnaire by A. V. Karpov and V. V. Ponomareva. The profile of ego states was built using the transactional questionnaire of D. Jongeward (in V. K. Kalinenko's and V. A. Petrovsky's adaptation). The Existence Scale developed by A. Langle, K. Orgler (revised by S. V. Krivtsova, I. N. Majnina and A. Yu. Vasanov) was applied for the diagnosis of indicators of existential performance as a person's quality of life associated with a feeling of fullness of life with a particular meaning, free choice and responsibility. The features of hardiness and a method for solving the existential dilemma were identified using the S. Muddy's Hardiness Survey (modified by D. A. Leontiev, E. I. Rasskazova). Results. The outcomes of an empirical study of the ratio of personal and existential resources of the professional activity of teachers working with gifted students are demonstrated. Significant differences were revealed in the manifestation of hardiness and reflexivity in relation to form tutors with different types of personality ego-structures. Factor analysis made it possible to identify two factors, which demonstrate the existential-psychological and personal resources of the activity of form tutors working with gifted students: existential choice of a new professional experience and detachment from externally given rhythms and attitudes. Scientific novelty. The empirical capabilities of the existential-psychological, subject-activity and resource-based approaches to the study of the problems of the psychology of giftedness and the professiogenesis of teachers are tested. Practical significance. The demonstrated results can be used as part of a programme for developing the resources of professional activity of teachers working with gifted students.",1,1,Education & Educational Research

The results revealed that ordinary students spent, on average, approximately 20 minutes to generate 3.49 ideas per student. However, gifted students concentrated on the task for a longer time (roughly 60 minutes), and consequently generated greater (11.53) and more elaborate ideas. In comparing the ordinary students' fluency with their school science scores, no relationship was found between them.

Donation of large-sized gifts, though costly to prepare, can result in increased sperm transfer during mating and delayed remating of the females, resulting in higher paternity. Nuptial gifting sometimes causes severe female-female competition for obtaining gifts (i.e., sex-role reversal in mate competition) and selection on females to increase their mating rate, changing the intensity of sperm competition and the resultant paternity gains. We built a theoretical model to simulate such coevolutionary feedbacks between nuptial gift size (male trait) and propensity for multiple mating (female trait). Donation of nuptial gifts sometimes causes development of female persistence trait for gift acquisition. We also analyzed the causes and consequences of this type of traits, taking double receptacles for nutritious seminal gifts, which are known to occur in an insect group with a female penis (Neotrogla spp.), as an illustrative example. Results Our individual-based simulations demonstrated that female-female competition for male-derived nutrients always occur when the environment is oligotrophic and mating costs are low for females. However, a positive correlation between donated gift size and the resultant paternity gain was a requisite for the co-occurrence of large gifts and females' competitive multiple mating for the gifts. When gift donation satisfied female demands and thus resulted in monandry, exaggeration of nuptial gift size also occurred under the assumption that the last male monopolizes paternity. The evolution of double slots for gift acquisition and digestion (female persistence trait) always occurred when males could not satisfy the demands of females for gifts. However, through coevolutionary reduction in male gift size, fixation of this trait in a population drastically reduced the average female fitness. Conclusion Sperm usage patterns, which have rarely been examined for animals with nuptial gifts, can be a critical factor for determining the extent of exaggeration in nuptial gifting. Sex-role reversals in mate competition, as a result of donation of nuptial gifts from males to females, can involve the evolution of male-like, persistent traits in females that reduce population productivity, as is the case with persistence traits in males.",1,1,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity

Depending on the dense increase of long-range phase synchronizations in the reasoning process, math-gifted adolescents show more significant adaptive reorganization and enhanced workspace'' configuration in the theta network as compared with average-ability control subjects. The salient areas are mainly located in the anterior cortical vertices of the fronto-parietal network. Further correlation analyses have shown that the enhanced workspace configuration with respect to the global topological metrics of the theta network in math-gifted subjects is correlated with the intensive frontal midline theta (fm theta) response that is related to strong neural effort for cognitive events. These results suggest that by investing more cognitive resources math-gifted adolescents temporally mobilize an enhanced task-related global neuronal workspace, which is manifested as a highly integrated fronto-parietal information processing network during the reasoning process.

Student outcome measures included science content achievement, engineering knowledge, and engineering engagement. The sample comprised 1,387 Grade 1 students across 62 classrooms. Multilevel modeling was used separately for each of the three student outcome measures. The intervention resulted in an effect size of 0.28 on an out-of-level science content assessment and effect size of 0.66 for the engineering knowledge measure. Students in the intervention group reported a high level of engineering engagement. General education teachers were trained to implement the curricula through a summer institute and received coaching throughout the subsequent academic year. Evidence suggests the intervention functioned as a talent-spotting tool as teachers reported they would nominate a substantial portion of low-income and culturally diverse students for subsequent gifted and talented services. Discussion focused on the match between the needs and preferences of students from low-income households for hands-on design experiences and the curricular affordances in the engineering domain as a talent development pathway for young, poor children.",16,16,Education & Educational Research; Psychology

Brandwein, author, scientist, teacher and mentor, publisher, humanist, and environmentalist, on gifted youngsters who later became scientists, based primarily on information gathered from surveys completed by 25 of his students and one colleague. It also traces his profound interactions with science educators. It illuminates the theories of Brandwein and his proteges and colleagues about the interaction of environment, schooling, and education and Brandwein's belief in having students do original research (that is, research whose results are unknown) on their way to discovering their future scientific paths. It tests Brandwein's 1955 hypothesis on the characteristics typical of the young who eventually become scientists, namely: Three factors are considered as being significant in the development of future scientists: a Genetic Factor with a primary base in heredity (general intelligence, numerical ability, and verbal ability); a Predisposing Factor, with a primary base in functions which are psychological in nature; an Activating Factor, with a primary base in the opportunities offered in school and in the special skills of the teacher. High intelligence alone does not make a youngster a scientist (p xix). The predisposing factor included traits he called persistence-a willingness to labor beyond a prescribed time... to withstand discomfort... to face failure-and questing-a dissatisfaction with present explanations of aspects of reality (p. 10). Brandwein's activating factor included opportunities for advanced training and contact with an inspirational teacher (p. 11).

The totality of such social relationships constitutes a network. Social networks characterise different types of social organisations including bands of small kin groups, tribal unions of families, and hierarchically organised chiefdoms. However, the factors and mechanisms that cause the transition between these types have hardly been explained. Here, we focus on gifts as the driving force for such changes. We build the model by idealising gift interactions and simulating the consequent social changes due to long-term massive interactions. In the model, people give their wealth to each other, produce wealth, and reciprocate for the gift. Gifts and reciprocation strengthen relationships. Through simulation, we demonstrate that, as the frequency and scale of gifts increase, economic and social disparities successively arise. Simultaneously, network structures shift from bands to tribes and then, chiefdoms. Statistical analysis using the Standard Cross-Cultural Sample, a global ethnographic database, empirically verifies the theoretical results. The constructive simulation study, as presented here, explains how people's interactions shape various social structures in response to environmental conditions.

The findings revealed three socio-mathematical norms (reformulations of problems, generating new problems, evaluation and correction based on the sufficiency of the information) that reflect the classroom's micro-culture, which involves problem posing. In addition to these basic norms, normative understanding related to posing more challenging problems allowed for challenging mathematical situations in the classroom, which is of particular importance for gifted and talented students.

Consequently, a natural and obvious conjecture is that measurement science is the science of sciences. In fact, it is a basis of all experimental and theoretical research activities. Each measuring process assumes an object of measurement. Some science disciplines, such as quantum physics, are still incomprehensible despite complex mathematical interpretations. No phenomenon is a real phenomenon unless it is observable in space and time, that is, unless it is a subject to measurement. The science of measurement is an indispensable ingredient in all scientific fields.

Accrediting bodies require assessment for accountability to ensure continuous improvement. Faculty at Christian higher education institutions join their secular counterparts in questioning the value of time-consuming assessment activities, disconnected from meaningful teaching designed to fulfill distinctly Christian missions, often understood as the integration of faith and learning. In 2016, Paul Kaak, faith integration editor of Christian Higher Education, called for explorers and cartographers to devise more detailed maps of academic faith integration leading to learning in all disciplines that is carried out in the light of faith (p. 189). This essay answers that call for an integration roadmap as it relates to assessment, planting signposts grounded in Reformed epistemology and framing it as science and story. Three key principles shape the argument: (a) educational assessment constitutes a God-designed natural act of human knowing and valuing, though finite and distorted by sin; (b) human fallibility necessitates assessment processes that are characterized by transparency, enabling learners to use their gifts for God's glory; and (c) assessment is most effective when enacted in a loving community of learners who recognize that performance does not determine worth in God's eyes.

Despite this, not all teachers were in favor of the selection of gifted children because the fact that they would then receive a different kind of education was not considered by them as being just. Second, we deal with a political campaign launched in 1927 to rescue the intelligent child of poor families in times of the Primo de Rivera dictatorship and the enthusiastic reactions this campaign received among the conservative sector of Spanish society. Thirdly, we review the selection of gifted children carried out during the 1920s and 1930s in the Psychotechnical Institutes. We expound the argument used to justify the need for a psychological selection based on tests and the conceptual and practical implications of the psychologists' (Germain and Rodrigo's) point of view.",0,0,History & Philosophy of Science

Compared with the average-ability subjects, the math-gifted adolescents show a highly integrated fronto-parietal network due to distant gamma phase-locking oscillations, which is indicated by lower modularity of the global network topology, more connector bridges between the frontal and parietal cortices and less connector hubs in the sensorimotor cortex. The time domain analysis finds that, while maintaining more stable phase dynamics of the fronto-parietal coupling, the math-gifted adolescents are characterized by more extensive fronto-parietal connection reconfiguration. The results from sample fitting in the power-law model further find that the phase-locking durations in the math-gifted brain abides by a wider interval of the power-law distribution. This phase-lock distribution mechanism could represent a relatively optimized pattern for the functional binding of frontal parietal network, which underlies stable fronto-parietal connectivity and increases flexibility of timely network reconfiguration.",7,7,Neurosciences & Neurology; Psychology

The participants in the sample were Black students (N = 3,173) who participated in the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009/2012. The student participants were in the ninth grade and ranged in age from 14 to 16 years. The results suggested that the model adequately fit the data, and that a direct relationship existed between OST enrichment and Black student participation in advanced science. In addition, Black female students participated statistically significantly more in advanced science than their male peers. Socioeconomic status also was a statistically significant indicator of advanced science course participation. Engagement in OST was not statistically significantly influenced by gender or socioeconomic status. This research extends the implications of informal science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) to support the diversification of advanced high school science courses and STEM participation by providing distinct estimates of the effects of OST on Black students.",9,9,Education & Educational Research

Various traffic types in the multi-tenant data center in the cloud environment have their characteristics and requirements. In the data center network (DCN), short and long flows are sensitive to low latency and high throughput, respectively. The traditional security processing approaches, however, neglect these characteristics and requirements. This paper proposes a fine-grained security enhancement mechanism (SEM) to solve the problem of heterogeneous traffic and reduce the traffic completion time (FCT) of short flows while ensuring the security of multi-tenant traffic transmission. Specifically, for short flows in DCN, the lightweight GIFT encryption method is utilized. For Intra-DCN long flows and Inter-DCN traffic, the asymmetric elliptic curve encryption algorithm (ECC) is utilized. The NS-3 simulation results demonstrate that SEM dramatically reduces the FCT of short flows by 70% compared to several conventional encryption techniques, effectively enhancing the security and anti-attack of traffic trans-mission between DCNs in cloud computing environments. Additionally, SEM performs better than other encryption methods under high load and in large-scale cloud environments.",0,0,Computer Science; Materials Science

Moreover, these tools should be used by students themselves for complete and systematic selection of their study materials and for the formation of personal strategies. The authors relied on materials that describe the direct use of elements of data science and artificial intelligence in the educational process (reports, interviews, etc.), on descriptions of prospective digital developments that can be re-oriented toward educational problems, on educational technologies that can become prototypes for developments in the field of data science and artificial intelligence. The following methods were used in the research: content analysis, systemgenetic and structural-content analysis, modeling of cognitive and social processes, forecasting. The study was conducted in the following mode: (1) research on basic theoretical ideas about data science and artificial intelligence, as well as ideas about their actual and potential social and sociocultural effects; (2) a primary study of practices of using these disciplines in the education system; (3) building of a hypothetical model of educational practice based on data science and artificial intelligence; (4) selection and analysis of materials about existing educational practices based on large amounts of data and complex software; (5) assessment of the advantages and disadvantages of existing digital educational resources; (6) modeling/forecasting of possible and necessary digital educational tools based on data science and artificial intelligence.

Through agglomerative hierarchical clustering for functional connectivity graphs and nested iterative cosine similarity tests, this study identifies seven general and one reasoning-specific prototypical functional connectivity patterns from all synchrostates. Markov modeling is performed for the time-sequential synchrostates of each trial to characterize the interstate transitions. The analysis reveals that default mode network, central executive network (CEN), dorsal attention network, cingulo-opercular network, left/right ventral frontoparietal network, and ventral visual network aperiodically recur over non-task or reasoning process, exhibiting high predictability in interactively reachable transitions. Compared to non-gifted subjects, math-gifted adolescents show higher fractional occupancy and mean duration in CEN and reasoning-triggered transient right frontotemporal network (rFTN) in the time course of the reasoning process. Statistical modeling of Markov chains reveals that there are more self-loops in CEN and rFTN of the math-gifted brain, suggesting robust state durability in temporally maintaining the topological structures. Besides, math-gifted subjects show higher probabilities in switching from the other types of synchrostates to CEN and rFTN, which represents more adaptive reconfiguration of connectivity pattern in the large-scale cortical network for focused task-related information processing, which underlies superior executive functions in controlling goal-directed persistence and high predictability of implementing imagination and creative thinking during long-chain reasoning.",2,2,"Neurosciences & Neurology; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging"

While traditional science education has been grounded on philosophical objectivism, a new paradigm of science education emerged in the late 20C converged on a constructivist theory, reflecting the short comings of science education to meet the needs of the post-industrial society. Constructivism is rooted in philosophical epistemology, which basically has two major traditions based in the psychological and sociological disciplines. However, the constructivist movement in current science education is more heterogeneous. A recent review identified various interpretations of constructivism (R. Matthews, 1994), and Fetherston (1997) has argued that the constructivism as applied to science teaching is undertheorised. Therefore, this lack of common meaning for most constructivist approaches can not contribute significantly to theory development. Furthermore a firm theory could lead to practical reform in science education. However, the Korean situation has not yet been investigated with regard to this problem. Accordingly, the current study analyzed research papers that appeared in the Journal of the Korean Association for Research in Science Education since 1978, which is the most popular and influential Journal published by the Korean Science Education Society As a result, some hidden meanings concerning constructivism are discussed, the trends of science education research in terms of current themes are identified, and finally some implications and recommendations are suggested with regard to the basis of science education.",0,0,Education & Educational Research

Until recently, the general assumption assumed by most countries was that talented children have no special needs or difficulties in order to succeed in school and life. Talent nurturing and management became a challenge for teachers. Unfortunately, the support for initial and in-service teacher training for gifted education is yet insufficient. In this context, we consider it important to know the opinion of master candidates in the domain of educational sciences regarding the usefulness, content, strategies for stimulating/realizing talent promotion in the present Romanian school, as well as the causes that support or complicate these approaches. The present study was conducted in the second semester of the academic year 2017-2018. The research method was a questionnaire applied to 71 master candidates at the Innovative Strategies in Education master study programme from Vasile Alecsandri University of Bacau, Romania The purpose of this observative study is to identify the master candidates' perception of this issue with a view to ensuring a higher convergence between their professional training interests and the content studied during the master program.

Next, numerous studies have demonstrated the pedagogical importance of gestures in the demonstration of scientific knowledge in the classroom. Drawing on social semiotic systemic functional theory and legitimation code theory, this study explores the types and the role of gestures in the semiotic construction of scientific knowledge in pedagogic semiosis and their pedagogical values for the meaning-making of science content. With this aim, a gesture observation protocol (GOP) is developed to annotate and analyze data. Two science lectures, which are broadcast remotely for middle school students including gifted students, are observed. Systemic Functional Multimodal Discourse Analysis (SF-MDA) method is employed to analyze and evaluate data. Results demonstrated that the deployment of gestures that contributes to the construction of scientific knowledge is low and deployed gestures mostly do not have pedagogical value. It is recommended that teachers should be more conscious and educated about deploying gestures to present scientific knowledge efficiently.",0,0,Arts & Humanities - Other Topics; Social Sciences - Other Topics

These data were jointly analysed with 5331 harvest weight records from three generations to estimate genetic parameters and correlated selection responses. Multiple trait animal models were used in the analyses. The potential for correlated responses was evaluated by estimating heritabilities and genetic correlations between body traits (weight, length, depth and width) and fillet traits (weight and yield) with the above mentioned flesh characteristics. The heritabilities for protein%, fat% and colour were low (0.06-0.11), whereas for moisture% and pH they were moderate (0.15-0.20). Genetic correlations among some flesh characteristics (moisture% with protein%, fat% and pH and with fat%) as well as between body and fillet traits with flesh characteristics, were significantly different from zero but low (-0.34 to 0.31). Correlated responses were evaluated by comparing the least squares means between the Selection and Control lines. Our results indicate that selection for high growth increased harvest weight in the Selection line relative to the Control line but it did not change the flesh characteristics of the GIFT strain.",7,7,Fisheries

We cloned and characterized the LPL gene from GIFT. Finally, we determined the effects of dietary lipid levels and refeeding on hepatic LPL gene expression in GIFT. The LPL gene of GIFT (Oreochromis niloticus) (O.nLPL) was 2,298 bp in length and encoded 515 amino acids. Sequence analysis showed that O.nLPL shared 57.3-87.9 % identity with LPLs from other piscine species. To study LPL expression patterns, juveniles GIFT were fed diets containing 3.7, 7.7 or 16.6 % crude lipid for 90 days and the expression of hepatic O.nLPL was examined using real-time PCR. The abundance of hepatic LPL mRNA increased with increasing dietary lipid. The expression of O.nLPL mRNA in the 16.6 % dietary lipid group was significantly higher than that of the 3.7 % lipid group (P < 0.05). The expression of O.nLPL was increased in GIFT following a 48-h fast and decreased 12 h after refeeding. Hepatic LPL mRNA returned to fasting levels 48 h after refeeding. In summary, high dietary lipid induced expression of liver O.nLPL, and expression of liver LPL is regulated by fasting and refeeding.",16,17,Fisheries

Polymorphisms of genes related to androgen metabolism, however, have not been previously analyzed in association with spatial abilities. Our study analyzes genetic polymorphisms of androgen receptor (AR), aromatase (CYP19), and 5-alpha reductase (SRD5A2) in relation to mental rotation and spatial visualization in prepubertal intellectually gifted boys. DNA samples of 36 boys with an average age of 10.0 +/- 0.7 years and an IQ higher than 130 were isolated from buccal cells in saliva. DNA was subsequently used for amplification by PCR. The CYP19 C-1558-T polymorphism and SRD5A2 A49T polymorphism were determined by RFLP analysis, and the AR (CAG)(n) polymorphism was determined by fragment analysis. Salivary testosterone levels were measured with radioimmunoassay. Spatial abilities (mental rotation and spatial visualization) were assessed using standard psychometric tests. AR and CYP19 polymorphisms were not associated with spatial abilities. Heterozygotes in A49T polymorphisms (AT) of SRD5A2 had significantly better results in both mental rotation and spatial visualization tests compared to AA homozygotes. TT homozygotes were not found. The T allele of A49T polymorphism of the SRD5A2 was reported to have a 5-fold increased activity in comparison to the A allele. AT heterozygotes outscored AA homozygotes in tests of spatial performance. Since dihydrotestosterone - the product of 5-alpha reductase catalyzed reaction - has a higher affinity to AR, this might indicate a potential molecular mechanism for the influence of SRD5A2 polymorphism on spatial abilities in intellectually gifted prepubertal boys.",6,7,Psychology; Neurosciences & Neurology

According to the authors, sustainable development across social, environmental, and economic dimensions is unlikely to occur without redefining the meaning and recalibrating the metrics used to measure commodities. These meanings and metrics must align with values such as general reciprocity, morality, and the common good, going beyond mere calculations of means and ends and personal preferences. The research has three primary objectives: first, to compare and reassess the meanings and responsibilities assigned to items traded in indigenous and modern economies; second, to use Hegelian dialectics to enhance and transform the notion of a commodity by revising and expanding its current understanding; and third, to introduce a new construct-the giftized commodity-along with potential implicational scenarios and recommendations for its inclusion in theory development in stakeholder capitalism, sustainable consumer behavior, and ecological economics.

In the sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields, the avocational interests of the most successful professionals are unusually likely to involve fine arts such as painting or music; literary accomplishments; or crafts such as woodworking and metalworking, mechanics and electronics. Four types of evidence are brought together in this review to explore why such avocations might stimulate the creative capacity of STEM professionals. First, STEM professionals themselves argue that beyond verbal and mathematical skill, success requires a vivid visual and spatial imagination; hand-eye coordination and manipulative ability; skill with making and interpreting models; and a highly developed aesthetic or artistic sensibility. Second, controlled statistical studies of large groups (hundreds to thousands) of STEM professionals reveal strong correlations between artistic, musical, literary and crafts activities and measures of success in STEM subjects such as Nobel Prizes, numbers of patents or companies founded. Third, STEM professionals involved in these statistical studies themselves can describe specific ways in which their avocations stimulate their vocational successes. And fourth, many of these specific stimuli (such as improved observational and visual thinking skills, manipulative skills and tool use, and improved learning and retention strategies) also improve STEM learning in well-controlled classroom trials.

Drawing primarily on the work of Rauna Kuokkanen and the logic of the gift', we argue that the application of Western quality indicators' to learning and teaching for Indigenous content demonstrates an innate lack of institutional understanding of the complexities of teaching interculturally and the unlearning' which needs to occur for students to become critically self-reflexive and develop capacity for ontological pluralism (essential for graduate intercultural capability). According to Kuokkanen, for Indigenous people social order is maintained through giving and recognising the gifts of others, including the land; the logic of the gift, therefore, represents a radical critique of the entrepreneurial and measured university, which relies on one narrow idea of the world and human relationships. The transactional approach typically used to embed Indigenous knowledges into university courses thus illustrates the prevailing epistemic violence enacted on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Importantly, in addition to Kuokkanen's work, we also apply Martin Nakata's notion of the cultural interface' to dissociate from essentialist notions of Indigeneity (and indeed the university) to imagine how Indigenous studies can open a dialogue about reciprocity, hospitality and the current limits of the academy's conceptualisation of quality'.",30,30,Education & Educational Research

Our goal is to examine the identities of students in the camp and the valued actions according to which these identities were authored, both by the students and by their instructors. Data was collected from three rounds of summer camp sessions and included recordings of lessons, staff meetings, and ceremonies. Findings point to identities of competent or gifted participants being evaluated according to the valued actions of quickness and ease in problem-solving, brilliant ideas or questions, persistence and coping with challenges, and intensive engagement with mathematics, beyond the official requirements of the camp. They also suggest that most of these valued actions were only implicitly communicated in the camp, although some of them, for example writing correctly and justifying statements logically, were stated explicitly. We focus on one student, Jasmine, who was identified as particularly gifted. We examine an episode of fierce mathematical argumentation between her and the instructor (2nd author), and the identifications that accompanied it, relating them to the valued actions in the camp.

The heritability for survival rate was low (0.038), and so was its genetic correlation with harvest weight (0.065), suggesting that selecting for the latter trait would have had no effect on survival. The calculation of the probability of survival by spawning season and line, fitting a model that included the random effects of individual animal and common environment, confirmed this prediction. There were very small and variable between line differences in the probability of survival, which generally favoured the selection line.

All school staff has increased awareness and knowledge about that. They develop a special program for identification of gifted student and a curriculum for them. In addition, existing gifted education pays too much attention to their curriculum, such as a curriculum compacting, acceleration, and an ability clustering. Currently, the identification of gifted student mainly depends on a simple identification test based on their age. But, the test results could not reveal the potentially gifted students. In this paper, we proposed a neural network model for identification of gifted student. With a specially designed questionnaire, we measure implicit capabilities of giftedness and cluster the students with similar characteristics.

Yet, the impacts of grade skipping in adulthood are unclear. Using data from Terman's longitudinal study of gifted children, we examined income differences from 1936 to 1976 between grade skippers and non-grade skippers after controlling for birth year, IQ, home environment, personality, and intellectual, social, and activity interests via propensity score modeling. After also controlling for adult education attainment, men who had skipped a grade earned an average of 3.63%-9.35% more annually than non-grade skipping men. The impact for grade skipping women was much smaller: 2.02%-0.42% annually. These results indicate no association between full-grade acceleration and income for women in this historic dataset, but suggest a slight relationship between the two variables for men (though whether this relationship is causal is unknown). Additionally, income gaps between accelerated and non accelerated students did not narrow until the subjects were nearing the end of their careers.

As a result, nonsmokers in China are particularly susceptible to smoking. While previous studies have examined cigarette gifting behaviors among smokers, little is known about cigarette gifting among nonsmokers. Aims and Methods This study aimed to examine the percentage and correlates of giving and receiving cigarettes as gifts among adult nonsmokers in China. We analyzed nonsmokers (N = 1813) aged >= 18 years using data from the International Tobacco Control China Wave 5 Survey. Descriptive statistics summarized the characteristics of those who gave and received cigarettes as gifts. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify factors associated with the two behaviors. Results Among nonsmokers, 9.9% reported giving cigarettes as gifts to family or friends in the last 6 months. A higher level of knowledge about smoking harms was associated with lower adjusted odds of gifting cigarettes. Nonsmokers aged 25-39 years, with middle income, positive attitude toward cigarette gifts, exposure to anti-smoking information, and exposure to smoking promotion, and those who reported receiving cigarettes as gifts from family or friends were more likely to give cigarettes as gifts. A total of 6.6% of nonsmokers reported receiving cigarettes as gifts in the last 6 months. High education, neutral or positive attitude toward cigarette gifts, exposure to anti-smoking information, exposure to smoking promotion, and having smoking friends were associated with receiving cigarettes as gifts. Conclusions It is concerning that Chinese cultural norms that support cigarette gifting have extended to giving nonsmokers cigarettes as gifts. Effective anti-smoking messages are needed. Changing the norms around cigarette gifting and increasing knowledge about smoking harms should help reduce cigarette gifting among nonsmokers. Implications Easy access to cigarettes received as gifts, along with the wide acceptance of smoking in China, places Chinese nonsmokers in a risky position. More educational campaigns targeting nonsmokers to proactively prevent them from smoking are called for. The ineffectiveness of existing anti-smoking information highlights the need for more effective anti-smoking messages. That attitude toward cigarette gifts is the strongest predictor of giving cigarettes as gifts suggests the need for interventions to reverse the positive attitude about cigarette gifting to decrease the popularity of this activity.",0,0,"Substance Abuse; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"

Both female and male undergraduate students of Maria Curie-Sklodowska University (MCSU), who majored in special education, participated in the study. The creative potentials of the LD and NLD groups of MCSU students were compared. The creative potential was investigated in two ways. First, the subjects were asked to think of as many uses as they could for a paperclip and a pencil (Alternative Uses Task by Guilford). Second, they were asked to complete a Creative Behavior Questionnaire (KANH) by Popek. Furthermore, the subjects were asked to complete a Rating Scale for Intensity of LD Symptoms. Thus, they were requested to self-report the intensity of their LD symptoms. It was found that nonconformity and heuristic behavior were the factors that differentiated the university students with self-reported LD from their peers in the NLD group. In general, taking into consideration the scores that were obtained in the KANH, the LD group obtained a lower level of creative potential, compared with the NLD group.

Gifted students have a range of unique abilities that characterize their learning process: mostly they differ in three key learning aspects: their faster learning pace, increased depth of understanding, and special interests. If gifted students are to develop their abilities and potential, and learn optimally in a regular classroom, the teaching must be adjusted to meet their special needs. Chemistry high-school curricula have built-in potential to cater to the special needs of gifted students. Chemistry learning entails laboratory work and comprehension of abstract concepts. In the classroom, the interactions between teachers and students are core events that trigger other class events. In the present study the interactions between teachers and gifted students in a regular classroom, which are specific for chemistry teaching, were studied. Two general categories of interactions with gifted students were found to be unique to the chemistry classroom: (1) interactions involving laboratory work and (2) interactions involving the challenge of teaching chemistry content. We found that since gifted students master abstract chemistry concepts quickly and with minimum scaffolding, no interactions regarding this aspect were reported. Gifted students do not need all the instruction time teachers usually devote to explaining abstract concepts in chemistry, concepts that are considered difficult for other students. The present study indicates the essential need of enhancing chemistry teachers' knowledge regarding teaching gifted students in the chemistry classroom. This includes knowledge about how gifted students learn in general, and its adaptation to the chemistry classroom and the chemistry laboratory according to academic and curricular needs of the gifted students.",7,7,Education & Educational Research

There is a general feeling that the scientific community is under a lot of pressure for fulfilling the criteria for upward growth and even retention of the positions held. The noble profession of scientific research and academics has been marred by the temptation to falsify and fabricate data, plagiarism and other unethical practices. Broadly speaking, the breach of ethics involves: plagiarism, falsification of data, redundant (duplicate) publication, drawing far-fetched conclusions without hard data, for early publicity, gift authorship (receiving as well as giving), not giving sufficient attention and consideration to scholars and post-docs as per the norms, self promotion at the cost of team-members, treating colleagues (overall all juniors) in a feudal way and Machiavellianism (cunningness and duplicity in general conduct and push to positions of power and pelf). Misconduct in Indian academics and science is also under a lot of focus. It is important and urgent that science, engineering, and health departments and institutions in our country have in place systems for education and training in pursuit of science with ethics by sound and professional courses in Responsible Conduct of Research. All research and academic institution must have the Office of Ethics for information, guidelines, training and professional oversight of conduct of research with the ethos and ethics of research.",2,4,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Microbiology

In this research, Filipino high school students with inclination towards and receiving advanced instruction in science answered motivation and learning strategy scales twice, in relation to science and social studies. Domain-latent factors were found in a multitrait-multimethod analysis, indicating domain specificity.

They underestimate their own talents in mathematics and the sciences and, from a motivational perspective, attribute their successes and failures in such a way as to further inhibit motivation. Attributional retraining techniques could provide a solution to the problems of lowered motivation and performance. These retraining techniques have proved successful in clinical and laboratory settings, but they have not been tried in natural settings like schools and universities. Following an overview of the most important attributional retraining techniques, we describe two studies carried out with German high school students in mathematics and with female university students in statistics. Using an attributional retraining technique we developed, both studies report extremely promising results.

However, it is unknown whether class-average levels of intelligence influence teachers' nominations as suggested by theory-and corresponding empirical results-concerning reference group effects. Herein, it was hypothesized that when students' individual fluid and crystallized intelligence scores were similar, students from classes with higher average levels of intelligence would have a lower probability of being nominated for an enrichment program for gifted children than students from classes with lower average levels of intelligence. Furthermore, we investigated whether 3 teacher variables-experience with giftedness, beliefs about the changeability of intelligence, and the belief that giftedness is holistic or domain specific-would influence the expected reference group effect. In a study comprising data from 105 teachers and 1,468 of their (German) third-grade students, we found support not only for a positive association between students' individual intelligence scores and the probability that students would be nominated as gifted but also, more importantly, for the proposed reference group effect: When controlling for individual levels of intelligence, students' probability of being nominated was higher in classes with lower average levels of intelligence. In addition, the results showed that this reference group effect was stronger when teachers saw giftedness as holistic rather than domain specific.

The National Research Center reported that, nationwide, 7.47% of all Caucasian students and 9.9% of Asian students are placed in gifted programs. Meanwhile, 3.04% of African-American students, 3.57% of Hispanic students, and 4.86% of Native American students are classified as gifted [1]. Since research hypothesizes that gifted attributes are distributed across ethnicities, these statistics demonstrate that urban minority gifted students are being neglected by the current education system [2]. Gifted students in minority groups not only remain unidentified, but those identified are not being serviced well enough to enable them to achieve their full potential since there is a lack of able teachers, faulty assessment techniques, social and psychological barriers. Significant demographic shifts in metropolitan areas have resulted in magnet schools where student bodies are increasingly multiracial, multiethnic, multilingual and multicultural [3] [4] [5]. Moreover, federal and state government initiatives, such as No Child Left Behind are commanding public attention and directing funding toward increasing minority participation in programs trying to close the achievement gap and developing America's talent [6]. The country's economic crisis makes it more imperative that educational institutions utilize innovative methods, that are efficient but effective, to develop the potential of urban minority gifted students. The present paper explores how distance learning blended with traditional schooling can serve this purpose by overcoming the barriers to academic achievement that urban minority gifted children face, such as fewer support networks, lack of preparation, lower self esteem and social rejection.",0,0,Education & Educational Research

This multiple case study examined the ways in which young adults, who in the past had been identified as gifted, made sense of their giftedness based on cues obtained from their social environment and the impact of this sensemaking on their development. Some participants made sense of their giftedness in a way that prevented them from developing a sense of agency in their education: Their sensemaking was based on social control or, conversely, on effortless learning and easy victories they experienced in childhood. The participants who showed the highest level of achievement and motivation in early adulthood perceived themselves as agents of their learning and made sense of their extraordinary outcomes as resulting from effortful, proper, and self-directed practice. Our findings indicate that a sense of agency is critical to maintaining gifted-level achievement through adolescence.

Completely randomized designs were followed to constitute seven distinct experimental groups and each group comprised of three experimental units. Fifteen juveniles (3.16 +/- 0.01 g) were randomly stocked in each experimental unit. During the 60-day feeding trial, juveniles were fed with their respective experimental diets thrice daily at an apparent satiation level. The results revealed that growth (weight gain percentage, thermal growth coefficient and specific growth rate) and feed and nutrient utilization (feed conversion ratio, protein efficiency ratio and apparent net protein retention) were improved significantly with an increment in dietary methionine levels up to 12.3 g/kg, and methionine supplementation beyond that did not give extra benefit in relation to growth performance. Dietary methionine supplementation at various levels had no effect (P > 0.05) on the body indices, survival, carcass moisture and ash content and carcass essential amino acid composition of GIFT juveniles. The carcass protein level increased with an increment in dietary methionine levels up to 12.3 g/kg and then declined with further increment of dietary methionine level. However, carcass lipid content displayed the inverse trend of carcass protein content. GIFT juveniles fed a diet containing 12.3 and 15.1 g methionine/kg displayed elevated activities of liver and muscle aminotransferases activities, while the activity of digestive enzymes was unchanged among dietary groups. An increment of methionine up to 12.3 g/kg of diet resulted in a significant rise in serum protein and globulin concentration.

The ratio of males to females achieving very high scores on the mathematics subtest was 2:1, but this difference was only significant among 5th and 6th graders. Both males and females had a preference for mathematics over other subjects. More girls perceived their academic strengths to be in verbal areas, while most boys perceived theirs to be in mathematics and science.

The question is all the more noteworthy given that African universities have been facing unprecedented challenges: a shortage of lecturers to teach the growing cohorts of students and the extremely low proportion of full professors allowed to supervise master's and Ph.D. candidates are just a few examples. However, this article is derived from our sense of dissatisfaction upon reading the few studies that deal with this question, works that are largely characterized by a lack of empirical rigor. It is built on a body of rich and years-long fieldwork research in four countries in sub-Saharan Africa (South Africa, Ghana, Niger, and Nigeria), as well as interviews with African academics teaching in the U.S. and Canada. Based on a finely-tailored methodology, the article examines the nature of the resources that circulate to African universities from the academic diaspora; it also analyzes the causes of their unequal distribution. The article demonstrates in fine that the African engagement in higher education is not essentially the consequence of their subscription to a prescriptive patriotism. To be sure, the African academic diaspora are willing to contribute to the wellbeing of their continent. But the choice of the resources they share as well as the identity of their colleagues in Africa who directly benefit from these resources reveal that the structural constraints inherent to the academic profession ultimately inform their engagement in Africa.",0,0,Social Sciences - Other Topics

Currently, identifying refers to using a range of predefined criteria to recognise potential; providing to offering support for those identified; and developing to the process of defining, identifying, and providing talent in PE. This study aimed to examine secondary school PE teachers' perceptions of TD processes in PE. A purposive sample of 20 Spanish PE teachers was interviewed (n = 17 males and 3 females). Through thematic analysis, five main themes were identified. Teachers associated talented students in PE with physical abilities. Teachers suggested several limiting factors in identifying and supporting talent within PE, including a lack of curricular guidelines, knowledge, and time. However, some teachers acknowledged that they were not equipped with strategies for TD in PE. Some teachers employed strategies to limit the abilities of talented students and balance the level of the class, while others found it difficult to develop talent in PE. Additionally, extracurricular activities were considered to play a key role in TD. Furthermore, teachers' pedagogy might be biased when developing talented students in PE, as the difference between sports talent and PE talent is unclear.

The subject of female asceticism or renunciation in Hinduism has been far less examined than that of male renunciation. Recent feminist-conscious studies have pointed out that female ascetics are generally marginalized within, or completely excluded from, male-dominated ascetic communities, albeit some charismatic female gurus do manage to establish a measure of authority. But gender-based inequality is not the only form of inequality that matters here. This article explores the lives of female 'lay ascetics' who are regarded as neither authentic renouncers nor ordinary householders. While male ascetics are prioritized in receiving alms, most female ascetics must struggle to obtain alms through making use of their social networks. Female ascetics cooperate with each other in this for both their mutual advantage and for spiritual reasons. Yet serious competition over alms can and does arise, which can generate moral dilemmas and severe conflict. Through ethnographic descriptions of their gift exchanges, this article will clarify how female ascetics form social networks which are neither completely obligatory nor completely free.",1,1,Area Studies; Asian Studies

In the studies of acceleration conducted so far a multidimensional perspective has largely been neglected. No attempt has been made to relate social-emotional characteristics of accelerated versus non-accelerated students in perspective of environmental factors. Aims. In this study, social-emotional characteristics of accelerated gifted students in the Netherlands were examined in relation to personal and environmental factors. Samples. Self-concept and social contacts of accelerated (n = 148) and non-accelerated (n = 55) gifted students, aged 4 to 27 (M = 11.22, SD = 4.27) were measured. Method. Self-concept and social contacts of accelerated and non-accelerated gifted students were measured using a questionnaire and a diary, and parents of these students evaluated their behavioural characteristics. Gender and birth order were studied as personal factors and grade, classroom, teachers gender, teaching experience, and the quality of parent-school contact as environmental factors. Results. The results showed minimal differences in the social-emotional characteristics of accelerated and non-accelerated gifted students. The few differences we found favoured the accelerated students. We also found that multiple grade skipping does not have negative effects on social-emotional characteristics, and that long-term effects of acceleration tend to be positive. As regards the possible modulation of personal and environmental factors, we merely found an impact of such factors in the non-accelerated group. Conclusions. The results of this study strongly suggest that social-emotional characteristics of accelerated gifted students and non-accelerated gifted students are largely similar. These results thus do not support worries expressed by teachers about the acceleration of gifted students. Our findings parallel the outcomes of earlier studies in the United States and Germany in that we observed that acceleration does not harm gifted students, not even in the case of multiple grade skipping. On the contrary, there is a suggestion in the data that accelerated students are more socially competent than non-accelerated students. The findings in this study can reassure those parents and teachers who worry about the social-emotional consequences of acceleration in school: If a student is gifted, acceleration seems to be a sound and, in many cases, appropriate measure in gifted education.",19,20,Psychology

Our design accepts two types of voice by workers regarding the contract wage with their firm, both defined as cheap talk. One voice communicates only the desirable wage for the workers, whereas the second voice additionally communicates their future efforts. We find that both types of voice do not increase firms' offers but instead reduce agreement contract rates. Furthermore, they undermine workers' reciprocity regardless of the wage levels offered by the firm, thus reducing the effort levels post-agreement in an incomplete employment contract. Additional experiments revealed that the voice's adverse effects persist even for repeated interactions. However, workers' voices, including future efforts, lead to higher wage offers, which outweigh the adverse effect on workers' reciprocal behaviors; that is, it increases the effort level after the agreements.",0,0,Business & Economics

The present study investigated the psychometric properties of 10 tests for measuring of SA in a sample of talented schoolchildren. Objective. Our purpose was to identify the most suitable measurements for SA for the purpose of talent identification, educational assessment, and support. Design. Our sample consisted of 1479 schoolchildren who had demonstrated high achievement in Science, Arts, or Sports. Several criteria were applied to evaluate the measurements, including an absence of floor and ceiling effects, low redundancy, high reliability, and external validity. Results. Based on these criteria, we included the following four tests in an Online Short Spatial Ability Battery OSSAB: Pattern Assembly; Mechanical Reasoning; Paper Folding; and Shape Rotation. Further analysis found differences in spatial ability across the three groups of gifted adolescents. The Science track showed the highest results in all four tests. Conclusion. Overall, the study suggested that the Online Short Spatial Ability Battery (OSSAB) can be used for talent identification, educational assessment, and support. The analysis showed a unifactorial structure of spatial abilities. Future research is needed to evaluate the use of this battery with other specific samples and unselected populations.",5,5,Psychology

Based on Ackerman's (1996) notion of trait complexes, specific interest profiles of gifted high-school graduates can be expected. Aims.Vocational interests of gifted and highly achieving adolescents were compared to those of their less intelligent/achieving peers according to Holland's (1997) RIASEC model. Further, the impact of intelligence and achievement on interests were analysed while statistically controlling for potentially influencing variables. Changes in interests over time were investigated. Sample.N= 4,694 German students (age: M= 19.5, SD= .80; 54.6% females) participated in the study (TOSCA; Koller, Watermann, Trautwein, & Ludtke, 2004). Method. Interests were assessed in participants' final year at school and again 2 years later (N= 2,318). Results.Gifted participants reported stronger investigative and realistic interests, but lower social interests than less intelligent participants. Highly achieving participants reported higher investigative and (in wave 2) higher artistic interests. Considerable gender differences were found: gifted girls had a flat interest profile, while gifted boys had pronounced realistic and investigative and low social interests. Multilevel multiple regression analyses predicting interests by intelligence and school achievement revealed stable interest profiles. Beyond a strong gender effect, intelligence and school achievement each contributed substantially to the prediction of vocational interests. Conclusions.At the time around graduation from high school, gifted young adults show stable interest profiles, which strongly differ between gender and intelligence groups. These differences are relevant for programmes for the gifted and for vocational counselling.",21,22,Psychology

Often, a gifted person has difficulties in the system of social interaction and adaptation. This contradiction does not allow them to maximize their potential in their chosen profession, and also complicates the sphere of personal communication. These features are exacerbated in early adolescence at the stage of professional and personal self-determination. The identified problem determined the purpose of this study: to identify the reasons for the low social adaptation of intellectually gifted students through observation and psychodiagnostics; to identify current trends in correctional and developmental work; to formulate recommendations on the organization of effective psychological and pedagogical support of high school students in order to increase the level of their social adaptation at the stage of educational and professional training. Research methods: method of theoretical analysis and generalization; formative experiment; free observation in teaching practice; techniques: R. Amthauer's TSI (subtests 2, 3 and 6) and an option for adults of D. Veksler's scale; social and psychological adaptation of K. Rogers and R.

Research results: the selected diagnostic tools made it possible to establish that the main range of problems of gifted students is in the field of social development and adaptation. These results made it possible to determine the main areas of correctional and developmental work and ways to overcome them: development of goal-setting, teaching students to use their intellectual abilities to solve social problems. Key findings and their significance. The main areas of correctional and developmental work lie in the development of communication skills, increasing the level of social maturity through the expansion of strategies and tactics of effective social behavior.",0,0,Agriculture; Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research; Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Social Sciences - Other Topics

Competing hypotheses were formulated, comparing the core-deficit view to the twice-exceptionality view on compensation with giftedness-related strengths. The results showed no indication of compensation of dyslexia-related deficits by giftedness-related strengths in gifted children with dyslexia. The higher literacy levels of borderline children compared to gifted children with dyslexia seemed the result of both fewer combinations of risk factors and less severe phonological deficits in this group. There was no evidence for compensation by specific strengths more relevant to literacy development in the borderline group. Accordingly, the findings largely supported the core-deficit view, whereas no evidence for the twice-exceptionality view was found.

The results remain largely inconsistent. Studies testing groups of people with very low or very high skill levels in math sometimes found relationships between SNARC and math skills. So far, however, studies testing such extreme math skills level groups were mostly investigating the SNARC effect in individuals revealing math difficulties. Groups with above average math skills remain understudied, especially in regard to children. Here, we investigate the SNARC effect in gifted children, as compared to normally developing children (overall n = 165). Frequentist and Bayesian analysis suggested that the groups did not differ from each other in the SNARC effect.

Using psychologists' studies of giftedness, media coverage of the topic, and guidebooks for parents of gifted children, I argue that giftedness emerged in the 1910s, and by the 1920s addressed a newly limited definition of intelligence and problems in urban public education, coinciding with the popularity of the culture and personality school. Scholarly debates about giftedness traveled from the academy to the wider public through the media and guidebooks for parents. Media coverage brought awareness of the problem of the neglected gifted student, and guidebooks offered parents practical suggestions about how to raise gifted children. I show that the discourse contributed to racial segregation in American schools and classrooms by using merit to determine access to educational opportunity. Experts' advice about giftedness also altered expectations about childrearing and encouraged parents to become more involved in their child's educational development. This argument puts the history of psychology in conversation with histories of parenting, and it evidences how the discourse on giftedness impacted institutional inequality both through merit-based gifted and talented programs and by impacting ideologies of parenting. Thus, I provide a more comprehensive account of how and why giftedness profoundly shaped both the school and the home. This article considers the cultural work the discourse accomplished; it gave the public the impression that disparities in educational achievement between individuals and groups could be explained by the parenting a child received, putting significant pressure on all parents to make educational achievement a top priority for their child.",0,0,History & Philosophy of Science

They were asked to design experimental procedures without any guidelines or help. Students' EDs were analyzed qualitatively to extract difficulties that students experienced when designing experimental procedures. Based on analysis results, 17 factors were identified as factors to be considered for students' ED and structured in a form of checklist. In the second step, the checklist was provided to 50 students in the gifted center as guidelines for their ED. They were then asked to design experimental procedures. Comparing scores of these students' ED with those of the control group, it was found that these factors were significantly effective for improving students' ED with high effect size.

Due to the significance of the energy poverty problem, a growing body of literature has extensively explored its definitions, measurements and causes. However, tradi-tional criteria lack a nuanced understanding of the complexity of China's current energy poverty. Meanwhile, there is growing interest in how social norms contribute to energy poverty traps or escapes. This article establishes a composite index by taking advantage of climate zones (considering both heating and cooling requirements), dwelling conditions and energy expenditures, which attempts to heteroge-neously identify households with underconsumption of energy behaviour as hidden energy poverty (hEP). Importantly, it further examines gift giving in relation to hEP. Employing panel data from China, this article discovers that 50.75% of households experience hEP. By robustly using a range of hEP metrics, this article reveals that gift giving increased the incidence of hEP. Particularly, compared with the income-poor group, the results suggest that the nonincome poor were associated with a larger economic burden from gift-giving expenses, which crowded out energy expenditures and eventually compressed energy needs. The focus of this article sheds light on a state-of-the-art outlook of capturing the multi-faceted nature of energy poverty and promoting policy-makers to facilitate appropriate social norms instead of simplistically targeting the poor in energy poverty eradication efforts.

Think-aloud interviews before and after the simulations were used to explore roles that debriefers adopted and the associated strategies they used to achieve specific goals. All data were audio recorded and transcribed, and a constructivist grounded theory approach was used for analysis. Results 4 roles in debriefing were identified: guiding, (inter)mediating, facilitating integration, and teaching. Each role was associated with specific goals and strategies that were adopted to achieve these goals. The goal of creating and maintaining a psychologically safe learning environment was common across all roles. These findings were conceptualized as the GIFT debriefing framework.

Producing a large nuptial gift is a considerable cost to the male, but it may improve his siring success if the female reduces the likelihood to accept another male after receiving a large gift. The female may receive a direct benefit by accepting another male who provides an additional nuptial gift. Additionally, the female may receive an indirect fitness benefit via laying offspring sired by a male who is able to produce a large nuptial gift. We formalized the multivariate quantitative genetics model describing the coevolution of the size of nuptial gift produced by the male (x) and the female's propensity to engage in remating (y). We analyzed the model focusing two cases: [1] remating females receive no indirect fitness benefit, but enjoy direct benefit of nutrition; and [2] remating females receive no direct benefit, but enjoy an indirect fitness benefit due to a positive genetic correlation of x and y, which is possible if random mutations tend to make males produce small nuptial gifts. In both cases, the stable evolutionary equilibrium with neither nuptial gift nor remating ((x) over bar = (y) over bar = 0) always exists. Another stable equilibrium may exist in which male produces nuptial gifts ((x) over bar > 0) and female engage in multiple mating ((y) over bar > 0). We discussed implications to the sexual conflict.

It is owing to auditing of information systems requires a great experience and several skills, as well as depth knowledge about all the stakeholders involved in the auditing industry (e.g., chief executive/information officers, auditing customers, certifiers, auditors, etc.). This fact together with a lack of motivation can cause a strong discrepancy between potential and success in learning with students. This lack of motivation is mainly due to auditing is a bit outside of more technical disciplines of computer science degree. This explains why highly skilled students show poor performance under the same dispositions while one can find averagely gifted among the best of the group. It is hardly possible to attain good achievements without motivation. To deal with these two problems (i.e., auditing unfamiliarity and lack of motivation) a new teaching-learning strategy based on serious game was conducted. This strategy transformed a traditional practical exercise based on case studies into a serious game based on the distribution of students in groups, assignment of roles and real-life, industrial case studies. Lessons learned of this experience demonstrated that students were highly motivated and the auditing learning process was improved.",0,0,Education & Educational Research

At the present time, a state and a social request for the guidance of gifted children and teenagers, seen as comprising the primary intellectual potential of a developing society, is being articulated. As a general rule, giftedness is an adjunct to nervousness, extreme sensitivity, internal contradiction and low resistance to stress. These mental disorders may prevent a young person from forming of the proper picture of the world and developing capabilities of forming confidential and harmonious relationships. In this regard, it is necessary to identify appropriate approaches and means for ameliorating the maladaptive behaviour of gifted pupils. The aim of the research was to find out to what extent the personal locus of control determines aggressive and destructive behaviour on the part of intelligently gifted teenagers. Methodology and research methods. The research was performed on the basis of systematic and person-oriented approaches to studying the individual characteristics of students. The types of locus of personal control were determined using J. Rotter's methodology as adapted by E. F. Vazhin, S. A. Golynkina and A. M. Etkind. As diagnostic tools, E. P. Ilyin and P. A. Kovalyov's measurement procedure and the Buss-Durkee questionnaire were used to estimate the level of personal aggression and proneness to conflict. Results were subjected to comparative and statistical analysis using the U-Kruskal - Wallis test allowing the authors to establish the average indicator values of various pupil categories participated in the research. Results and scientific novelty. To identify intelligently gifted teenagers, the authors applied a comprehensive programme, which included the methods of psycho-diagnostics, expert estimates of teachers and parents, observation and conversations. Consequently, respondents were divided into four differentiated groups: intelligently gifted externalisers, intelligently gifted internalisers, medium-intelligence externalisers, and medium-intelligence internalisers. In the course of diagnostics, it was established that domination of the external or internal locus of control causes the specifics of aggressive behaviour among intelligently gifted teenagers and their peers having an average level of intellectual development. Statistically significant differences in indicators such as physical aggression, irascibility, irritability and irritation were revealed. An internal locus of control in a gifted person reduces physical aggression and irritability. Gifted externalisers are more inclined to use physical force in conflicts. This group is also characterized by a lack of emotional self-control, irascibility, fieriness of temper, instability, intolerance, oppositional moods and remonstrative behaviour - from passive resistance to active fighting against norms and laws which they believe to be inappropriate for them. The authors concluded that intellectually gifted teenagers with an external locus of control are in the category of teenagers-at-risk in social and psychological adaptation; therefore, they require more attention and psychological assistance. The organization of psychological and pedagogical guidance to pupils will help minimize conflicts between participants (school students and teachers) in the educational process. Practical significance. The research results can be used as informative and reflexive material by educational psychologists and teachers working with intelligently gifted children and teenagers.",1,1,Education & Educational Research

In addition, to examine the association of such knowledge and attitude of dentists' behavior with industry, including sorts of interaction and accepting industrial gifts. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among dental practitioners working in the private and governmental hospitals located in the various regions of Saudi Arabia. A self-administrated questionnaire was developed and distributed to all participants. Fourteen questions assessed the socio-demographic, economic, and occupational characteristics of the participants including age, gender, nationality, monthly revenue, income satisfaction, hospital setting, job rank, specialty, and patients' socio- economic status. Seventeen questions assessed the interaction with DSRs, acceptance and characteristics of gifts and opinion of dentists regarding gift acceptance in dental practice. One-Way ANOVA and t-test was used to examine differences in transformed scores by socio-demographic, occupations and outcome characteristics. All P-values were two-tailed. P-value < 0.05 was considered as significant. Results: Total of 672 participants responded to general questions related to the knowledge and attitude. The mean of the overall knowledge and attitude score was 64.3 +/- 7.2, general questions score was 63.1 +/- 8.6 and interaction questions score was 66.9 +/- 8.0. Approximately, 40% of participants disagreed that accepting industrial gifts can affect their own decisions but slightly lower proportion (25%) disagreed that accepting industrial gifts can affect decisions of other dentists. Only 25% of participants thought it is ethical to accept industrial gifts and even fewer proportions (20%) believed that dental supply representatives (DSRs) always provide accurate information about their new materials. Almost two-thirds of participants trusted information from other sources than from DSRs. On the other hand, 40% of the participants were against banning industrial gifts to dentists and approximately 50% were against informing the patients about the industrial gifts given to their dentist by dental companies. Conclusions: There was insufficient knowledge and an overall positive attitude towards the dental industry among the sample of dentists in Saudi Arabia. Well-designed ethical education programs should be implemented to enhance knowledge and attitudes about the interactions with dental industry.

Ability grouping can lower students' academic self-perceptions through reference group effects of class-average achievement on academic self-concept (ASC) - the Big-Fish-Little-Pond-effect (BFLPE; Marsh & Parker, 1984, J. Pers. Soc. Psychol., 47, 213). Although the effect itself is well documented, many open questions remain. For instance, negative contrast effects of group average achievement and positive assimilation effects of group status are confounded in most BFLPE studies. For the verbal domain, no study has yet investigated contrast and assimilation effects simultaneously. Strong assimilation effects can be assumed for gifted ability grouping. Aims. We aimed at disentangling contrast and assimilation effects of full-time within-school gifted tracking on verbal ASC and math ASC. Sample. Students attended regular or gifted classes within the top track of German secondary schools. Our sample comprised 1,330 fifth-grade students (42 regular classes, n = 1,069, 48% female; 15 gifted classes, n = 261, 39% female). Methods. Using multilevel regression analyses, we simultaneously modelled negative contrast effects of class ability and positive assimilation effects of class type (regular vs. gifted) on ASC in math and the verbal domain. Results and conclusions. In the mathematical domain, the assimilation effect, caused by membership in gifted classes, compensated for negative contrast effects of class-average achievement on ASC even after controlling for previous ASC. In the verbal domain, we found neither a significant contrast effect nor an assimilation effect. Implications for gifted education are discussed.",14,14,Psychology

It is hypothesized that nuptial gifts represent an honest signal resulting from the trade-off between self-maintenance and mating effort. Furthermore, nuptial gift size may correlate with certain personality traits, such as male fighting or hunting abilities. We investigated the nuptial gifts of a gift-giving spider, Pisaura mirabilis, consisting of both exogenous (prey) and endogenous (silk) components and their relationships to male biometry (the honest signalling hypothesis) and personality traits (the personality traits hypothesis). The gift's weight in the field was positively correlated with male size providing support for the honest signalling hypothesis. No differences in body condition and fluctuating asymmetry between males carrying and not carrying gifts in the field were found which does not support the honest signalling hypothesis. A substantial proportion of males offered worthless gifts that were smaller and lighter than genuine gifts. Reliable personality traits of males were not identified and no behavioural or survival differences between males carrying nuptial gifts, unwrapped prey and not carrying gifts in the field were observed. These results suggest that male size serves as an honest indicator of the exogenous component of the gift (i. e. the nuptial prey). (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

The model of education, which is guided by the logic of economic growth, and not by the logic of human development, leads to a general dehumanization of education and society. 2. The process of education dehumanizing is manifested in the following destructive trends: pragmatic utility and convenience of gaining knowledge; the dominance of technical knowledge and the transfer of humanitarian disciplines into optional courses; the advance of online education; the imperfection of university lecturers' ratings and their transformation into a bureaucratic evaluation system; new types of inequality in education. 3. In Russia, the above-mentioned trends are aggravated by the abnormal establishment of market economy; the verticalization of power and the lack of professionalism in university management; social sphere underfunding; the aggressive implementation of the Bologna system. 4. The current crisis in education is accompanied by the large-scale emigration of gifted students and lecturers. The authors recommend to consider the University as a classical home of formation, preservation and transfer of culture; online courses should be seen as a new format of teaching aids, as well as a technological tool for retraining and for people with disabilities.",1,1,Education & Educational Research

Students were identified as being analytically gifted, creatively gifted, or analytically-creatively gifted. In general, results showed increasing levels of analytical ability and stable levels of creative ability. In addition, hierarchical regression analyses showed a positive effect of the enrichment programme on the development of analytical abilities in children with relatively low starting levels of analytical ability (i.e. the creatively gifted students). To conclude, results suggest that rather than analytically gifted children, children with creative talents gained most advantage from participating in the computer-based enrichment programme.",1,1,Education & Educational Research; Psychology

Dynamic testing has been proposed as a testing approach that is less disadvantageous for children who may be potentially subject to bias when undertaking conventional assessments. For example, those who encounter high levels of test anxiety, or who are unfamiliar with standardized test procedures, may fail to demonstrate their true potential or capabilities. While dynamic testing has proven particularly useful for special groups of children, it has rarely been used with gifted children. Aim. We investigated whether it would be useful to conduct a dynamic test to measure the cognitive abilities of intellectually gifted children. We also investigated whether test anxiety scores would be related to a progression in the children's test scores after dynamic training. Sample. Participants were 113 children aged between 7 and 8 years from several schools in the western part of the Netherlands. The children were categorized as either gifted or average-ability and split into an unguided practice or a dynamic testing condition. Methods. The study employed a pre-test-training-post-test design. Using linear mixed modelling analysis with a multilevel approach, we inspected the growth trajectories of children in the various conditions and examined the impact of ability and test anxiety on progression and training benefits. Results and conclusions. Dynamic testing proved to be successful in improving the scores of the children, although no differences in training benefits were found between gifted and average-ability children. Test anxiety was shown to influence the children's rate of change across all test sessions and their improvement in performance accuracy after dynamic training.",6,9,Psychology

The aim of this study was to determine the strategic flexibility indicators displayed by gifted children in solving non-routine problems. A case study method was used. The study group consisted of 20 eighth, ninth, and tenth grade students attending the Science and Art Centre in Bursa, Turkey. A test consisting of seven non-routine problems was used. The problems in this test were asked to each student one by one by conducting individual interviews. The content analysis results revealed three themes. Under the first theme, strategy adaptivity, there were two indicators: Strategy knowledge and selection of the appropriate strategy. Under the second theme, intra-task strategic flexibility, four indicators were defined: changing the strategy when it did not work, solving the problem again with a different strategy, the ability to use several strategies simultaneously for solving a problem, checking the correctness of the solution with a different strategy. The last theme, inter-task strategic flexibility, consisted of only one indicator named changing strategies when encountering different problems.",1,1,Education & Educational Research

Finalists were quite successful and stayed mostly within science and medicine for their career choice. A rather high-although marginally unequal-portion of male (91%) and female (74%) finalists earned a doctoral degree. Women were also more likely to change to non-scientific professions than men. Among the most compelling findings from the NAS study were: age that scientific talent was recognized by self and others was an important predictor of early publication, which in turn was an important predictor of lifetime productivity. Growth curve analyses suggested a cubic model best fit productivity data over time. Moreover, in both samples there was an association between scientific achievement and recent immigrant status.

We integrated the Eye Tracking technology to pedagogy-didactic research because we have some experience with the use of it. Eye Tracker - Gazepoint version - is currently one of the most available technology systems that enable user's eye movements observing. Our paper deals with the pilot research presentation of the grammar school students using Gazepoint for visualization of processes and strategies used by students for tasks solution focused on chemistry. The main target was to find out how pupils proceeded during monitoring of given tasks on the screen, in what way they worked with it and after that to find out basic differences between the group of gifted students and the group of standard ones, if any. We tried to reveal strategies that were used by students during solving the tasks focused on high school chemistry. On screen, students were presented by tasks that had to be solved one by one. Gazepoint recorded their eye movements, saccades and fixations. Important data were gained by it and we carefully analysed them. The analysis served us for the exact disclosure of advances that every student chose for solution the given tasks. In this paper, we focused on comparison of advances of three gifted students and three standard students. From the sample of 28 grammar school students at the age of 16 that participated in tests, we have chosen six respondents - three gifted and three standard students. The common parameter for this choice was that standard or gifted ones were only boys, they were nominated by their teacher (in addition, one of the trio had a professional diagnostics provided by pedagogy-psychological advisory centre) and chosen tasks were solved correctly. Gained outputs were evaluated and mutually compared. The research target was to find differences in attitudes to solving the given tasks between both groups of respondents and alternatively to highlight specifics of the gifted ones group. Partial target was to discover some difference in attitudes to tasks solution between both groups of students for teachers contending with inclusion and to recommend them basic educational advances that can be effectively used in education. We are aware of the fact we processed only the pilot study and our results are not possible to make general. Despite this fact, we think that our recommendation can make work of current teachers easier and it can serve to deeper knowledge of differences that occur among student in one class.

Outcome measures used in the trial have recently been reported on (Mooney, Winter, & Connolly, 2016). Findings. showed no significant effects in terms of improvements to children's literacy skills and/or enjoyment of reading. Through in-depth interviews with 20 foster children, their carers and the programme developer, the qualitative evaluation focused on how and why the intervention did not achieve greater impact. Findings illustrate differences between the 'hoped for' outcomes of the intervention, and carer/child levels of engagement with and experiences of the programme. In order to move the programme forward and begin to explore the findings, a logic model is suggested which accounts for the current findings regarding the use and lived experiences which carers had with the packs.

However, it is still unclear when and how these cortical interactions occur. In this paper, we used directional coherence analysis based on Granger causality to study the interactions between the frontal brain area and the posterior brain area in the mathematical frontoparietal network system during deductive reasoning tasks. Specifically, the scalp electroencephalography (EEG) signal was first converted into a cortical dipole source signal to construct a Granger causality network over the theta-band and gamma-band ranges. We constructed the binary Granger causality network at the 40 pairs of cortical nodes in the frontal lobe and parietal lobe across the theta-band and the gamma-band, which were selected as regions of interest (ROI). We then used graph theory to analyze the network differences. It was found that, in the process of reasoning tasks, the frontoparietal regions of the mathematically gifted show stronger working memory information processing at the theta-band. Additionally, in the middle and late stages of the conclusion period, the mathematically talented individuals have less information flow in the anterior and posterior parietal regions of the brain than the normal subjects.

Experimental students were exposed to concept-based science curriculum that emphasized 'deep learning' though concept mastery and investigation, whereas control classes learned science from traditional school-based curricula. Two ability measures, the Bracken Basic Concept Scale-Revised (BBCS-R, Bracken 1998) and the Naglieri Nonverbal Intelligence Test (NNAT, Naglieri 1991), were used for baseline information. Additionally, a standardized measure of student achievement in science (the MAT-8 science subtest), a standardized measure of critical thinking, and a measure for observing teachers' classroom behaviors were used to assess learning outcomes. Results indicated that all ability groups of students benefited from the science inquiry-based approach to learning that emphasized science concepts, and that there was a positive achievement effect for low socio-economic young children who were exposed to such a curriculum.",17,17,Education & Educational Research

The idea that society enhances human capital and competitiveness through the development of education, science, and innovation is grounded. Intellectual capital is a real resource accumulated based on the human, social potential of society. In this context, the role of universities, as research and educational centers, as a special academic environment in which students receive deep professional knowledge and are formed as individuals with a high culture, is being actualized. It is suggested that a higher school at the present stage should be ready to train gifted and already very well trained applicants, meet their needs and provide a high-quality level of teaching. The authors emphasize the need of cultivating knowledge in the modern world. The idea of person's improving and technological progress now more than ever takes root in our minds - to be competitive, you need to be able to do what you will need to do tomorrow. The article holds the idea that the 21st century is embraced by such a trend as accelerated obsolescence of experience. Technique and science, progressing with astonishing speed, contribute to the obsolescence of a large number of phenomena and, accordingly, human experience in certain areas. Universities are becoming a kind of hubs of the modern professional world - knowledge is always insufficient, skills are not very developed, skills require even more practice. The results of an empirical study of the ideas about successful learning and the features of the perception of the problems of successful learning by subjects of the educational process are presented. The perception of the success of the educational process at the university is similar among respondents (graduates of various universities and specialties); respondents emphasized the social factor of success. In order to be successful, it is not enough just to have a knowlrdge, it is also necessary to be able to do what others are unable to do. New technologies are increasingly being introduced into the everyday area of human's life. In such conditions, the value of a person's unique creative activity rises. Higher education in Russia and Kazakhstan responds to these challenges of our time, realizing the need for a new methodology and the introduction of alternative teaching methods. Therefore, the Ural Federal University since this year is changing the forms and content of training, moving to a mixed format of training on online platforms and project forms. All of the above indicates that a modern person needs to have knowledge of a new format. Our era puts forward new, sometimes seemingly unattainable requirements for a person as a professional. That is why the cult of knowledge is not only a factor of competitiveness, but also a factor in the existence of modern man.",2,2,Education & Educational Research; Social Sciences - Other Topics

The reasons are manifold, including the lack of interest of girls because of existing stereotypes of male nerds, misconceptions in the field of computer science, and concrete differences in students' self-concept and performance. Girls do not choose schools or studies in the field of computer science because working on computers or coding is unattractive to them. Research shows poorer performance, missing interest, and lower self-concept for girls in secondary computing education as well as a high dropout rate of female students in computer science courses at the bachelor's level. Software development exams contribute to those high dropout rates, and women often choose a different subject or even stop their university education altogether. This leads to fewer female employees in the field of computer science, and this situation calls for special measures at several levels. The current paper provides an overview of the initiatives of our university that aim to address several aspects of the gender gap. The programs offered aim to (1) increase interest in computer science and recruit (highly) gifted girls for our talent programs, (2) recruit and support female bachelor's and master's students in computer science, and (3) redesign programming courses and teaching materials to reduce the gender gap in performance and support, especially for female students. This study also describes a cyber tutoring program in which highly gifted girls between 13 and 16 years collaborate with and are supervised by female role models in higher positions in STEM. The evaluation results gained in the first year of this case study are promising and suggest that the extension and further development of the program would be advantageous.",0,0,Education & Educational Research; Engineering

Personality was more strongly related to behavioral strengths and difficulties than to achievement in all tracks. As such, personality traits may be indirectly linked with achievement via behavioral strengths and difficulties. For example, narcissism correlated negatively with behavioral difficulties but did not significantly correlate with achievement. However, achievement was correlated negatively with behavioral difficulties. Network analyses indicated that teacher-awarded grades, but not anonymous exam grades, were weakly connected with personality. Specifically, teachers awarded higher grades to students with more 'desirable' personality traits such as high agreeableness. Results also showed track differences in the networks of personality, behavior and achievement.

In order to establish the empirical basis of these motivational strategies, two studies were conducted with samples of students from a specialized post-secondary business school who were enrolled in grades 11-13. Study 1 focused on the empirical basis of the homeostatic orientation. It was shown that the availability of learning resources is associated with two forms of balance within an actiotope: robustness and resilience. Furthermore, it could be shown that the effects of exogenous learning resources on robustness and resilience are mediated by endogenous learning resources. The focus of Study 2 was the empirical basis of the allostatic orientation. It was shown that the availability of learning resources is associated with various indicators of growth of an actiotope. Similarly to Study 1, the effects of exogenous learning resources on outcome variables representing the growth of an actiotope were mediated by endogenous learning resources. Thus, evidence suggests that a homeostatic orientation as well as an allostatic orientation are valid motivational strategies for gifted educators.",7,7,Education & Educational Research; Psychology

From the environmental side, educationalists have argued for the importance of the environment for sustaining early potential in children, showing that bright poor children are held back in their subsequent development (Feinstein, 2003a). Such correlational data need to be complemented by mechanistic models showing how gifted development results from the respective genetic and environmental influences. A neurocomputational model of cognitive development is presented, using artificial neural networks to simulate the development of a population of children. Variability was produced by many small differences in neurocomputational parameters each influenced by multiple artificial genes, instantiating a polygenic model, and by variations in the level of stimulation from the environment. The simulations captured several key empirical phenomena, including the non-linearly of developmental trajectories, asymmetries in the characteristics of the upper and lower tails of the population distribution, and the potential of poor environments to hold back bright children. M a computational level, 'gifted' networks tended to have higher capacity, higher plasticity, less noisy neural processing, a lower impact of regressive events, and a richer environment. However, individual instances presented heterogeneous contributions of these neurocomputational factors, suggesting giftedness has diverse causes.",7,10,Psychology

Using a largely philosophical methodology, we will argue that GT assumes an instrumental form of rationality underpinned by a logic of self-interest, hence placing individuals, communities, and their social practices in service of external goods and their maximization. Because of this, GT is not adequate to describe the entirety of human social existence and interaction. Nevertheless, by revealing these assumptions, GT can be amplified with another form of rationality based on realist ethics and a personalist anthropology reinforced by the logic of gift. This rationality values the singularity of each person as a holistic unity, as the center of the social realm and as an end in herself called to growth and flourishing with others, nurturing the human community through giving and receiving. We will thus provide a wider philosophical framework for GT with a series of non-mathematical axioms of what can be called a Game Metatheory (GMt). These axioms refer to society as a complex system, not to particular interactions. GMt axioms are not a model of social games, but rather an axiomatic description of social life as a game, revealing its systematic character, complexity, and possible deterioration.",0,0,Psychology

The programs took place on a college campus. The splashdown effect was defined as program-related changes the program graduates recognized in themselves that became apparent to them after reentry to their home high school. The effect was studied in a group of 88 gifted girls and boys from 38 high schools. On qualitative and quantitative measures obtained during private interviews, students reported a strong splashdown effect after returning to their high school. Results supported the validity of the splashdown concept. Splashdown motivation and splashdown confidence (i.e., recognition of program-related gains in motivation and confidence that occurred after high-school reentry) predicted change in corresponding science attitudes during the follow-up period. As predicted by social comparison theory, the intensity of the splashdown effect was associated with average school achievement in the student's home high school. Students from academically weaker schools reported stronger splashdown effects.

Purpose: This study explores how essential scientific competencies of inquiry can be integrated into classroom teaching practices and investigates both typical and gifted secondary students' emotional perception and engagement in learning activities. Sample: A case teacher along with 226 typical and 18 gifted students from a suburban secondary school at Taiwan participated in this study. Design and methods: After attending twelve 3-hour professional development workshops that focused on scientific inquiry teaching, the case teacher voluntarily developed and elaborated her own teaching activities through the discussions and feedback that she received from workshop participants and science educators. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected through activity worksheet, questionnaire, video camera, and tape recorders. Frequency distribution, Mann-Whitney U test, and discourse analysis were used for data analyses. Results: Case teacher's teaching activities provide contextual investigations that allow students to practice making hypotheses, planning investigations, and presenting and evaluating findings. Students' learning outcomes reveal that typical students can engage in inquiry-based learning with positive emotional perception as well as gifted students regardless of their ability level. Both gifted and typical students' positive emotional perception of and active engagement in learning provide fresh insight into feasible instructions for teachers who are interested in inquiry-based teaching but have little available time to implement such instructions into their classrooms. Conclusions: The results of our work begin to address the critical issues of inquiry-based teaching by providing an exemplary teaching unit encompassing essential scientific competencies",4,6,Education & Educational Research

It replaces the previous segregated policy in which racial groups were not allowed to attend same schools and requiring learners with disability to attend schools separately from those without disabilities. Since IE policy was introduced in 2001, disgracefully, there have been only few examples of success. Many schools that were chosen to pilot IE policy implementation have not been successful. In fewer schools though, there have been some remarkable developments on IE policy implementation trials. Mixed outcomes of the trials have therefore occurred. The study wanted to determine the reasons for IE successes and failures in the pilot schools, and to include possibilities of enriching the children to an optimal extent. A purposive sampling was used to select a size 11 sample of school officials and delegates of IE workshops held in Mpumalanga Province and other areas in the years 2002 to 2013. The study showed that some schools could implement IE while others failed. Factors preventing IE successes include that education departments neither assisted nor supported with funds and equipment. The IE successful schools showed that they had relevant resources and equipment, including funds. There, education officials monitored and controlled, were honest, transparent, respected their obligation, fulfilled promises, and supported the program. It was recommended that education departments should be transparent and visible to those who need to engage in dialogues with education officials.

In Study 2, we further explored how to optimize CubeMuseum AR by adopting a user-centered design approach. Through the analysis of expert interviews (N = 7) and an online survey (N = 207), the results specify a series of requirements and design guidelines for tangible AR interfaces to be used as a learning tool and a hybrid gift. Based on the findings, the design of the CubeMuseum AR was optimized and evaluated in Study 3. A between-subjects user study was conducted (N = 32) to compare the optimized design with the initial design. The results verified the positive effects of gamified tangible AR interfaces on users' motivation, engagement, and performance in learning cultural heritage. We present our design and evaluation results, and discuss the implications of designing tangible AR interfaces for cultural heritage learning and museum gifting.",0,0,Computer Science; Engineering

An important aim was to demonstrate the value of creativity in science education and the role of knowledge to inform art making; while showing the natural symbiosis that exists between the two disciplines, conducive to engaging learners and producing valuable outcomes. Art and science teaching is embedded in a methodology with great opportunities for developing transferrable skills by allowing pupils a greater degree of input into the organisation of their own learning. It creates an environment where pupils of all abilities noticeably connect with learning, as willing and active participants, possessing ideas they are eager to develop. The model used is developed from our earlier work in primary education known as The Leonardo Effect: Synchronised Integration of Art and Science in Primary Education. This interdisciplinary model is based on identifying subject commonalities such as researching by observing at first hand; finding out information by asking experts; exploring through taking things apart; developing ideas by creating experiments and making prototypes based on pupils' newly acquired knowledge. Flexible planning for teachers is an integral feature. In the primary phase of the research 22 schools from across the UK and Ireland were studied. All schools implemented the approach via the theme of ` flight'. Responses were obtained from head teachers, class teachers, parents and children. All groups found the approach to be advantageous and to stimulate learning. Teachers and head teachers reported that learning in the two specific areas of art and science was greatly enhanced. In addition, learners' transferable skills were strongly developed. One unpredicted outcome was that teachers found integrating art and science in a theme had significant benefits for children's literacy attainment. Combining art and science was also found to support children who previously showed little enthusiasm for schoolwork, while allowing gifted children to reach higher levels. Parents were very supportive and reported that children were very motivated and engaged their families in the area of study. Five years later the approach is well established in over 100 UK schools. The secondary phase was conducted in six schools in the UK. Here schools were free to select their own theme and these ranged from life underwater to design of clothing for extreme environments. Schools structured the interaction between subjects in different ways, tailoring it to suit their individual circumstances. Again feedback from teachers and heads was very positive in relation to both learning and development of transferrable skills and creativity. Teachers enjoyed the aspects of co- teaching across subject disciplines. They were surprised by the degree of engagement that pupils displayed when exposed to this type of teaching. Strong parallels between the positive outcomes from this approach in both phases were noted, however, when compared with primary schools it was clear that secondary schools had more difficulty in obtaining optimal outcomes. A number of factors caused problems for these schools. Important among these were: teachers' attention being drawn away by examination preparation for senior classes; timetabling difficulties; lack of adequate information transfer between teachers; and inconsistent school management support. Schools that succeeded best had the combination of consistent management support, opportunity for flexible timetabling; and highly committed teachers who could work easily with colleagues from another discipline. However some concerning comparisons could be made between application in the primary and the secondary sectors. For example: The approach involving researching, developing ideas and applying knowledge in primary schools ensures increased depth of learning for children. We expected even greater depth of learning experience for pupils in secondary, given that the children are older. However, what we found was less depth achieved compared with primary. We concluded that this was due to the more disjointed nature of the learning experience in secondary due to school time-tabling. Teachers commitment to developing their practice and improving the learning experience for pupils is more likely to be thwarted in secondary due to very many pressures relating to running the secondary system. We conclude that interdisciplinary teaching of art and science is an extremely useful tool for engaging learners and promoting transferrable skills, in particular literacy. It could also be a useful antidote in addressing the drop in academic attainment that is frequently observed in the transition between primary and secondary education. Perhaps the strongest message of all is that secondary school education lacks flexibility, and is at a disadvantage when compared with primary schools, where adapting, evolving and changing can be more easily accommodated. This leaves secondary schools poorly placed to embrace curricular challenges and may be the reason why secondary school structures have barely changed in fifty years.",0,0,Education & Educational Research

We combine a randomized controlled trial with a discrete choice experiment to analyze how financial education and other critical factors of a purchase decision like price, credit availability, information on product quality, and promotion affect consumer decisions at a young age. We find that students favor purchase options with free gifts and positive consumer reviews. They also prefer cash payments over credit. However, we do not find evidence that this behavior is triggered by financial education.

We consider the folklore contextualized in the territory because this generates a synergy between the experimental sciences, visual arts and music. It is essential and necessary to believe in the importance of treating folk music in the classroom, especially in the aspect of popular festivities, and expanding the art - science - society relationship. We approached this topic from different perspectives such as music, visual arts and experimental sciences, promoting the acquisition of interdisciplinary content and educational skills in a symbiosis that allows the transfer of knowledge in the social and cultural environment. People from every society and country meet through the fiesta; they organize, express their folklore and create a sense of unity forming an identity. We are convinced that the importance of addressing the different aspects presented by the folklore in the classroom and their unbreakable relationship with society is fundamental and necessary. It is also important to deep on the ongoing metamorphosis experienced by fiestas in our society, which maintains a precarious balance between local festival and globalization.

A male can contribute via the nuptial gift to his own offspring (paternal investment) and/or the nuptial gift may allow him to better transfer sperm or to make the female more willing to copulate (mating effort). From the female's perspective, however, weighing a male's quality according to the presence of a gift should coincide with her mating status, because male rejection by the virgin female may decrease her fitness by increasing the likelihood of remaining unmated. Therefore, female mate choice would depend on her mating status and virgin females are expected to be less choosy than mated females. I examined this hypothesis in the nursery web spider, Pisaura mirabilis, in which females are polyandrous and mate both with males with and without a gift. I found no support for my hypothesis; instead the presence of a gift was crucial in accomplishing successful copulation regardless of female mating status. Interestingly, sexual size dimorphism was found to be a significant predictor for duration of copulation.",17,17,Zoology

On the other hand, older adults are not only recipients of support but also important providers of support and financial transfers as giving and receiving are often reciprocal. For this, it is important to understand the determinants of receiving and giving money and help as well as the relationship between these two. Methods: The aim of this paper is to explore the relationship between giving and receiving of the same or of different types of transfers as well as to get more insights in the motivation behind giving and receiving of money gifts or informal care. We use data from the Survey of Health Aging and Retirement in Europe and employ a multinomial logit model to analyse 16 different categories resulting from combining information on the incidence of giving and receiving of both informal care and financial gifts. Results: We show that despite the differences that exist in the incidence of giving and receiving of both informal care and financial gifts there are clearly a few patterns that are consistent between the European countries in our analysis. Both 'altruistic-like' and 'exchange-like' motives are more likely to increase by age, gender and physical proximity of network members, while 'reciprocal-like' giving and receiving is more likely among females and those with a network at close distance. Conclusions: Our results show that the incidence of informal care and gifts to and from older people is related to particular characteristics and transfers patterns.

The Super Cup Gift Machine is a newly developed electronic game machine with a novel control mechanism that uses a Fire Electric Pen to negotiate a path, giving players different experiences. The machine's exterior is covered with sheet metal, which not only improves its stability and robustness, but also reduces its cost. The game machine operates using three mechanisms. Firstly, a timing belt pulley and belt driven by a motor driver allows left and right transverse sensors to move in the X direction. Secondly, movement in the Y direction is achieved with a guide bar and a linear bearing with a hoisting appliance. Finally, the reciprocating action in the Z direction is achieved using a slider crank mechanism. The inside of the old type of change machine, which converts coins into tokens, can only store 2000 tokens. To increase the storage capacity to 20000, we first used SOLIDWORKS drawing software to change the existing 3D stereogram; its internal redundant space was put to use, and a coin hopper able to bear the weight of 20000 tokens with a weight sensor was designed. Meanwhile, two inclined planes and an automatic coin-dropping device were added in the coin hopper to prevent multiple coins from dropping at one time and crushing the automatic coin-dropping device. Finally, finite element analysis of the developed structure was performed using ANSYS software, and a physical machine was made by assembling the parts. The designs were tested several times to prove the feasibility of the structure.",0,0,Instruments & Instrumentation; Materials Science

But there is no common sense, that theology should refer to values at all. The author argues (against Eberhard Jungel and others), that Christian freedom should be transformed to ethical values, that means to (ethical) goods, duties and virtues in order to become a wertvolle Freiheit (worthy freedom). Looking back the history of educational science, one of the fundamental dimensions of education always was ethical education. Today such ethical education should concentrate at the practice of different aspects of Christian freedom: Beginning with the experiences of the gift of freedom and love, freedom needs promising visions of God's kingdom and justice and must be trained as communicating and cooperative freedom in responsibility for each other. The methods of religious education in school and parish should consider all those dimensions of freedom. But first of all, the structures of educational institutions have to be in accordance to those visions of freedom.",0,0,Religion

Technologists attempted to take advantage of its superior thermal and mechanical properties to improve engine reliability and fuel economy. Yet, this promise was never realized in spite of the worldwide research, which was conducted at that time. Notwithstanding this disappointment, its use in medical applications in the early 21st century has been an unexpected gift. While retaining all of its engineered mechanical properties, it is now recognized for its peculiar surface chemistry. When immersed in an aqueous environment, the slow elution of silicon and nitrogen from its surface enhances healing of soft and osseous tissue, inhibits bacterial proliferation, and eradicates viruses. These benefits permit it to be used in a wide array of different disciplines inside and outside of the human body including orthopedics, dentistry, virology, agronomy, and environmental remediation. Given the global public health threat posed by mutating viruses and bacteria, silicon nitride offers a valid and straightforward alternative approach to fighting these pathogens. However, there is a conundrum behind these recent discoveries: How can this unique bioceramic be both friendly to mammalian cells while concurrently lysing invasive pathogens? This unparalleled characteristic can be explained by the pH-dependent kinetics of two ammonia species-NH4+ and NH3-both of which are leached from the wet Si3N4 surface.",33,34,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Materials Science

The main objectives of foreign policy of any state include the extension of its influence in the international arena. In the era of information and knowledge, one of the most effective tools for this task is soft power of education. In this respect, education is seen as a promising soft power instrument, which long-term character allows a country to promote not only its cultural, scientific and technological achievements, but also its cultural values and norms of social organisation. Today, universities are also seeking to strengthen their positions in global education rankings, which are used to define the status and reputation of a particular university in the global market of educational services. This ranking serves as a guide for future students and their parents, when choosing a prestigious education location and when developing individual career paths. The aims of the present research are the following: to analyse soft power of higher education as a soft power mechanism, which allows a country to achieve and maintain leadership positions in the international arena; to specify conditions, factors and barriers that determine the position of universities in global ranking systems. Methodology and research methods. The methodological framework is based on the concept of soft power and the theory of internationalisation of higher education. The empirical study was conducted following the tradition of qualitative sociological research. In 2018, a series of semi-structured interviews was conducted among Ural Federal University employees, whose responsibilities were related to the promotion of the university on the global educational market. The Ural Federal University (UrFU) can be considered representative in terms of practices aimed at attracting foreign students to the BRICS countries. In addition, UrFU is a place where the concept of a network BRICS University was realised in 2017. A total of 5 expert interviews were conducted. The collected data were analysed in the context of the World Bank statistics on the money spent by the BRICS countries on education and R&D during the 1999-2015 period (% of GDP), as well as the data provided by the QS World University Rankings - 2019 to analyse the reputation of BRICS universities. Results and scientific novelty. The case study of Ural Federal University allowed the authors to consider the specific practices of BRICS zones for attracting foreign students. The authors analysed the specifics of actions taken by a university to promote its international leadership positions in the international space on the example of students from China. It is shown that the role of global ranking systems (institutional and faculty) in the choice of a university is steadily growing. At the same time, factors determining the attractiveness of the Ural Federal University for foreign students, in particular for Chinese students, include a reasonable level of tuition, the quality of the education and the formed ethnic social networks. For them, the Russian education is expected to be a factor in achieving a higher social status in their home countries. This demonstrates the effective role of education as a soft power instrument, although in the long-term perspective. The authors identified a number of findings concerning the barriers faced by Russian universities on the way to recognising them as global actors of higher vocational education. It is possible to enter the Top 500 best world universities; however, the task of maintaining the achieved position in global rankings is more complicated and cannot be completed without a steady increase in the performance over several years. A world-class university should attract gifted youth, qualified teachers and researchers. The reduction in the number of talented people and research results leads to the loss of geopolitical mission by the educational organisation. Inadequate funding may prevent universities from breakthrough and sustainable improvement of their reputation. Practical significance. The research findings might be useful for managers of higher education and for strategists involved in positioning and making forecasts of educational institutions development. Also, the present findings can be applied by specialists engaged in the issues of educational policy, distribution of public investments, as well as the issues of international interaction and competition between states in order to realise national interests and support national economy in the country in the long term.",8,8,Education & Educational Research

Results demonstrated two significant models for academic outcomes: the negative relationship between low academic competency teasing and GPA was mediated by academic self-concept, and the negative relationship between low academic competency teasing and academic psychological engagement was mediated by academic self-concept. When the sample was split based on giftedness domain, the mediation using GPA was significant only for academically gifted students, whereas the mediation using academic psychological engagement was significant only for artistically gifted students. All mediations were confirmed using Sobel's test (1982). Results suggest that academic self-concept is a significant variable partially mediating the effects of teasing on gifted students' academic outcomes. Furthermore, giftedness domain should be emphasized because academic outcomes may vary by domain. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",9,9,Psychology

It contributes to a history of the present at a time when datafication and experimentalism are reappearing in educational policies to justify the reduction of inequalities across international surveys and randomised controlled trials. This socio-history of metrics also sheds light on transformations about relationships historically established between the welfare state and education that have shaped the representation of inequalities and social programs in education. The use of large-scale surveys and controlled experiments in social and educational policies developed in the 1920s and 30s, even if their methods and techniques have become more sophisticated due to statistical progress. However, statistical reasoning is today no less persuasive in justifying the measurement of student skills and various forms of state intervention for at-risk children and youth. With the rise of international organisations, notably the European Commission, demographic issues related to school population and the reduction of inequalities have shifted. It is less a question of selecting the most talented or gifted among working-class students than of investing in human capital from early childhood to improve the education systems' performance and competitiveness for the lifelong learning economy and European social investment strategy. This article attempts to illustrate this new arithmetic of inequalities in education at the European level.",2,2,Social Issues; Social Sciences - Other Topics

Investigating parents' stereotypes among 907 families in China, this study used exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses to uncover four latent factors: boys-Math, boys-Sciences, girls-Chinese, and girls-Liberal Arts stereotypes. The former two depicted boys as more gifted, enthusiastic, and higher-achieving learners in Math and Sciences, and the latter two favored girls in Chinese and Liberal Arts. This four-factor structure was invariant across parents with sons and daughters after accounting for the nonindependence of parents within families. The boys-Math and boys-Sciences stereotypes were found to be stronger than the other two stereotypes. Further analyses revealed nuances concerning the boys-Math stereotype: it was more pronounced among mothers than fathers in families with daughters, fathers with sons than daughters, and girls' mothers without college degrees than those with degrees. Within the same family, mothers more commonly held stereotype-consistent perceptions concerning Math and Chinese than fathers, but there was a general agreement over gendered perceptions of all four achievement domains regardless of child gender.

However, health professionals are often taught and supported in practice via deficit-based approaches that perpetuate inequity for Indigenous peoples. Deficit narratives in healthcare and health education are reproduced through practices and policies that ignore Indigenous strengths, disregard human rights, and reproduce structural inequalities. When strengths are recognised it is possible to build capacities and address challenges, while not losing sight of the structural factors impacting Indigenous peoples' health. Objective In this paper, we examine Indigenous strengths-based approaches to policy and practice in healthcare and health professions education when delivered alongside teachings shared by Elders from the Cree, Blackfoot and Metis Nations of Alberta, Canada. Method Literature and Elders' teaching were used to shift strengths-based approaches from Western descriptions of what might be done, to concrete actions aligned with Indigenous ways. Results Four pointers for future action adopting a strengths-based approach are identified: enacting gifts - focusing on positive attributes; upholding relationality - centring good relationships; honouring legacy - restoring self-determination; and reconciling truth - attending to structural determinants of health.

However, student satisfaction can also be stipulated as an important motivational factor for students as learners. This study combines this perspective on student satisfaction with the notion of differences in students' ability. We hypothesize that differences in ability result in differences in student satisfaction. In line with concepts of high ability education, it is additionally hypothesized that this relation is mediated by educational stimulation-divided in cognitive, creative and professional stimulation-as well as by participation in honour programmes. A structural equation modelling (N = 733) of factors affecting student satisfaction in higher education shows that cognitive, creative and professional stimulation are the largest influencers of bachelor students' sense of satisfaction. The interrelation between these three aspects of educational stimulation also shows the complexity of higher educational practice, since it suggests that cognitive stimulation cannot be realized without a creative factor, and vice versa. Professional stimulation needs both. Furthermore, the results show that educational stimulation mediates the effect of students' ability on their educational satisfaction. This implies that changes in education can indeed influence students' educational satisfaction, especially by providing educational quality. Finally, considering students' ability level, it is shown that especially cognitively abler students are less easy to satisfy. The combination of educational stimulation and ability suggests that especially the more cognitively able students do not feel themselves sufficiently cognitively or creatively stimulated, and hence are less satisfied in vocational higher education.",9,9,Education & Educational Research

The increased commodification of science corrupts it, scientific fraud is rampant and the age-old trust in science is shattered. This cynical view, although gaining in prominence, does not explain very well the surprising motivation and integrity that is still central to the scientific life. Although scientific knowledge becomes more and more treated as a commodity or as a product that is for sale, a central part of academic scientific practice is still organized according to different principles. In this paper, I critically analyze alternative models for understanding the organization of knowledge, such as the idea of the scientific commons and the gift economy of science. After weighing the diverse positive and negative aspects of free market economies of science and gift economies of science, a commons structured as a gift economy seems best suited to preserve and take advantage of the specific character of scientific knowledge. Furthermore, commons and gift economies promote the rich social texture that is important for supporting central norms of science. Some of these basic norms might break down if the gift character of science is lost. To conclude, I consider the possibility and desirability of hybrid economies of academic science, which combine aspects of gift economies and free market economies. The aim of this paper is to gain a better understanding of these deeper structural challenges faced by science policy. Such theoretical reflections should eventually assist us in formulating new policy guidelines.",13,14,Education & Educational Research; History & Philosophy of Science

A few controversial issues in this approach are related to tasks, subjects, raters' qualifications and performance, and methods for analyzing rating scores. This study addressed these issues under the theoretical framework of rater-mediated assessment and Rasch measurement theory. Data were collected from three groups of raters with different levels of expertise who assessed creativity of 24 6th graders in gifted and nongifted classes in two science tasks. Results indicated that (a) nongifted students showed higher creativity than gifted students in two science tasks, (b) three groups of raters had comparable scoring performances of creativity in two tasks, (c) only one rater exhibited differential rater functioning between nongifted and gifted students, but a few raters showed differential scoring between two science tasks. Implications of using rater-mediated assessment and Many-Facet Rasch measurement model to understand subjective creativity assessments are discussed, and future studies are suggested.",5,5,Arts & Humanities - Other Topics; Psychology

The author reconstructs the stages of their participation in the local economic systems and offers models of how their economic relations with village communities morphed into the religious ones. In the theoretical sense, the article is based on concepts and ideas of contemporary peasant studies, social anthropology (the institutions of gift and giving) and the historical studies of economic and communicative practices of Old Believers of the Ob-Yenisei region. For the sources, the article relies on the polemical and hagiographical works, diary entries and letters by Siberian skete dwellers, research expedition materials, memories and reports of government officials inspecting Old Believer sketes, with all sources dating between 1875 and 2020. The study is structured into two blocks: The skete as a collective agricultural worker and The skete as a collective forest gatherer, and focuses on proving the following theses. 1) The taiga sketes moved from the agrarian economy to forest gathering due to a number of external factors, such as collectivization and Sovietization of the village communities, and the state program of colonizing the Siberian taiga areas. However, this transition was legitimized by internal polemic on money, financial management of the skete and its dwellers' right to choose the forms of interacting with the outside world as they think fit. 2) The sustainability of skete households depended on how well the denizens of illegal monasteries could modify the hagiographically established concept of the 'fanner monk' and use the religious symbolism of 'alms' and 'commodity' to motivate peasant families to redistribute some of their food and labour resources to the benefit of the skete. 3) Exchanging gifts is the main communication strategy in the relations between the skete and the peasant community, as well as the instrument of building support of the rural environment and guaranteeing a benevolent attitude from the secular authorities.",0,0,Arts & Humanities - Other Topics; Social Sciences - Other Topics

First of all, people no longer understand themselves in the key of creation, they no longer understand themselves and the created world as gifts from the Creator, but are intoxicated with power combined with technology and science in the instrumental-rational key and understand themselves as the sole creators of their own fates. Relying on the hermeneutic key to understanding creation, Pope Francis starts from the Creator and exposes this crucial anthropological fallacy, the price of which has unforeseeable effects on the created reality. The paper points out the fundamental problems and difficulties of the modern ecological crisis, seeking to show that it is actually hidden in the crisis of the humanity. Following the contemplations and ideas that Pope Francis presented in the encyclical Laudato Si', the paper seeks to highlight the neuralgic points of the contemporary ecological crisis by showing ways out of the labyrinth of anthropological self-sufficiency. The need for and importance of education for environmental awareness, i.e., a responsible, mature and moral approach to created reality, are emphasized. In the final part of the paper, the rapprochement to freedom is highlighted, in line with the human dignity that has its source in God the Creator. Answering the question of why ecological education is important and crucial, the conclusion shows that it is the only right path of authentic humanity that bears the mark of creation in God's image, and that people are called to act responsibly towards the created reality.",0,0,Religion

To track gifted underrepresented minority (URM) students who entered the pipeline to health professional school when they were in high school and to determine whether and why students left the pipeline to enter other professions. Method. A questionnaire was mailed to 262 students who had participated in the Student Educational Enrichment Program (SEEP) in health sciences at the Medical College of Georgia between 1984 and 1991; 123 (75%) responded. Results. Students in the study population had higher graduation rates than the average state or national student Fifty-nine (48%) of the students had entered health care careers; 98% had seated that intention when they were in high school. Although some of the students stated trouble with course work and GPA as reasons for their decisions to change career tracks, many students said that their interests iri non-medical careers had been fostered by mentors or by opportunities to serve internships. Conclusion. Early intervention is important to retaining students in a pipeline that leads to a health care career. Summer programs are successful, but may not be enough to help students with difficult science courses in college, especially chemistry. However, another important conclusion is that much more needs to be done to help students find mentors with whom they can develop relationships and to give them opportunities to work in health care settings.",23,23,Education & Educational Research; Health Care Sciences & Services

This is important to address, as these concepts not only provide the foundation for more advanced topics in biology and chemistry, but are also threaded throughout both state and national science standards. Purpose: In this study, designed to determine the completeness and accuracy of three specific students' knowledge of molecule movement, concentration gradients, and equilibrium, I sought to address the following question: Using multiple evaluative methods, how can students' knowledge of molecule movement, concentration gradients, and equilibrium be characterized? Sample: This study focuses on data gathered from three students - Emma, Henry, and Riley - all of whom were gifted/honors ninth-grade biology students at a suburban high school in the southeast United States. Design and Methods: Using various qualitative data analysis techniques, I analyzed multiple sources of data from the three students, including multiple-choice test results, written free-response answers, think-aloud interview responses, and student drawings. Results: Results of the analysis showed that students maintained misconceptions about molecule movement, concentration gradients, and equilibrium. The conceptual knowledge students demonstrated differed depending on the assessment method, with the most distinct differences appearing on the multiple-choice versus the free-response questions, and in verbal versus written formats. Conclusions: Multiple levels of assessment may be required to obtain an accurate picture of content knowledge, as free-response and illustrative tasks made it difficult for students to conceal any misconceptions. Using a variety of assessment methods within a section of the curriculum can arguably help to provide a deeper understanding of student knowledge and learning, as well as illuminate misconceptions that may have remained unknown if only one assessment method was used. Furthermore, beyond simply evaluating past learning, multiple assessment methods may aid in student comprehension of key concepts.",2,2,Education & Educational Research

The background of their families ranged from poor indigenous remote villagers to academic families in developed countries, including parents of the gifted. Children's cognitive ability was measured with mental speed tests, Culture Fair Intelligence Test (CFT), the Raven's, Wiener Entwicklungstest (WET), Cognitive Abilities Test (CogAT), Piagetian tasks, Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT), Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS), Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), and Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). Parental wealth was estimated by asking for income, indirectly by self-assessment of relative wealth, and by evaluating assets. The mean direct effect of parental education was greater than wealth. In path analyses, parental education (beta(Ed)) also showed a stronger impact on children's intelligence than familial economic status (beta(In), total effect averages: beta(Ed) = .30-.45, beta(In) = .09-.12; N = 15,125, k = 18). The effects on mental speed were smaller than for crystallized intelligence, but still larger for parental education than familial economic status (beta(Ed -> MS) = .25, beta(In -> MS) = .00, beta(Ed -> CI) = .36, beta(In -> CI) = .09; N = 394, k = 3). Additional factors affecting children's cognitive ability are number of books, marital status, educational behavior of parents, and behavior of children. If added, a general background (ethnicity, migration) factor shows strong effects (beta(Bg) = .30-.36).

This conception opens the door for new ways of thinking about strategies and provisions of gifted education. In this theoretical analysis, I first critique the traditional trait conception of human potential undergirding gifted education practice. I then present an alternative, a process model of talent development, that views human potential as contextually and developmentally shaped, a result of dynamic interplay of endogenous and exogenous forces, revealing the power of nurture as well as nature.

Method: An anonymous survey questionnaire was circulated to 1,000 Libyan doctors in selected public and private practice settings in Tripoli, Benghazi and Sebha. Results: A questionnaire return rate of 61% (608 returned questionnaires) was achieved. Most respondents (94%) reported that they had been visited by PCRs at least 'once' in the last year. Fifty per cent of respondents met with PCRs at least once a month, and 20% at least once a week. The following characteristics were significantly associated with meeting with a representative more than once a week: age, gender (male > female), years of practice, being a specialist (other than an anaesthesiologist) or working in private practice. Ninety-one per cent of doctors reported that they had received at least one kind of relationship gift during the last year. Printed materials (79%), simple gifts (73%) and drug samples (69%) were the most common relationship products given to respondents. Reimbursements or sponsored items were reported by 33% of respondents. Physician specialists were more likely to receive drug samples or sponsored items than residents, general practitioners, anaesthesiologists or surgeons (P<0.01). Participants working in private practice alone or in both sectors were more likely to receive printed materials, simple gifts or free samples from PCRs than doctors working in the public sector (P<0.05). Conclusion: Libyan doctors are frequently visited by PCRs. Doctors, working in private practice or specialist practice, are especially targeted by promotional activities.

They are over-represented in high-performing schools, gifted and talented programmes and prestigious university courses. These achievements have generated both admiration and anxiety. Congratulatory voices depict Asian-Australians as a model minority, whose work ethic promises to enhance Australian schooling and propel the nation's meritocracy forward. Anxious voices worry about the escalation of a competitive culture, symbolised by excessive coaching and the tiger parenting' of Asian migrants. This paper examines the divided public attitudes on Asian-Australian education cultures through a discourse analysis of several hundred online comments posted in response to newspaper stories on Asian success' over the last five years. It identifies two competing discourses underlying these opinions: firstly, a pro-meritocratic, neo-liberal discourse, in which Asian-Australians embody the competitive spirit and aspiration required in a globalised economy, and secondly, a discourse of Asian-Australians as inauthentic learners whose excessive focus on schooling threatens the traditionally relaxed Australian approach to childhood and education. While these two discourses differ in their evaluation of Asian-Australian students, both share a culturally essentialist framework that explains educational outcomes in terms of culture'. The paper analyses the racial politics of this cultural essentialism.",13,13,Demography; Ethnic Studies

The Moravian-Silesian grammar schools are compared on the basis of average incomes in 2015-2017. The aim is to evaluate gaining of alternative resources by analyzed grammar schools established by the Moravian-Silesian. The research method is cluster analysis. The schools were divided into four clusters by results. The first three clusters are equal in number; the fourth cluster is atypical, containing one school, Gymnazium a SOS Rpmatov. This school shows extremely high values in incomes from other complementary activities and the lowest incomes from the programme Excelence. In terms of given criteria, the low numbers are shown with Erasmus+, which is caused by higher number of not involved schools. The research shows that none of the schools reaches extremely high incomes comparing to other schools in the most criteria.

Materials: During the investigation, the author used newly discovered archival documents as well as previous publications. Results and novelty of the research: It has been established that the term foreigners in the administrational documentation of the Muscovy in 16th-18th centuries indicated the yasak people from the river Volga to Eastern Siberia. The yasak for traditional yasak people signified a state duty (a tax) and yasak people had a votchina right on the yasak land. Yasak people can be preliminarily divided into three categories: 1. Yasak people in the Volga area. They were very similar to state peasants in an economic sense and the yasak was merely a vestige for them. Nevertheless, they preserved votchina rights on honey, lands and the hunting of beaver. 2. Ural, Western and Southern Siberian yasak people - hunters, fishers or pastoralists. For them, the yasak was basic type of the state tax corresponding to their local economies. Yasak traditions stemmed from period when these peoples were in sphere of influence or vassalage of post-Golden Horde states. The votchina rights of these peoples covered all over their territory. 3. North and Northeast Siberian populations who did not have advanced social structure and had never paid tax earlier. Any taxes were unclear to that population which is why the state formulated relations with them in understandable form - as an exchange of gifts. Thus, yasak populations were not all the same, and relations between the state and different groups were created along the lines of different schemes. At the same time, the yasak people formed a part of the social structure of the Russian state. An exception to the rule were some peoples in northern and northeast Siberia, where the situation must be considered separately for every clan/tribal group.",1,1,History

An evaluation found that although iron and folic acid (IFA) supplementation reached nearly all adolescent girls in schools during year 1, most girls received fewer than the minimum effective number of tablets over the school year. Barrier analyses highlighted schools as drivers of adherence, though information was incomplete on the reasons for the disparities among schools. Information was also lacking on the implementation of health and nutrition education. Objectives: At the start of year 3 of an integrated adolescent anemia prevention program with IFA supplementation, the present study sought to illuminate differences in program fidelity among schools and across time and potential factors that drive such differences. Methods: After stratifying by school level, size, geographic location, and intake adherence during year 1, 16 schools were purposively selected. For each school, semistructured key informant interviews were conducted with 1 coordinator at the district level, 3 educators at the school level, and 1 parent leader. Following thematic analysis methods, recorded and transcribed interviews were coded and organized into deductive and inductive themes. Results: Limited training, challenges during distribution of IFA, lack of incentives, and inconsistent health and nutrition education diminished program fidelity. Strong supply chain, widespread awareness promotion, improved acceptability, and intrinsically motivated educators improved program fidelity. After 2 y of implementation, schools had made program adaptations, and widespread changes in attitudes and beliefs about the IFA tablets had improved their acceptability. However, limitations remained related to supply chain, program ownership, communication between health and education sectors, training, motivation, and resources. Conclusions: The fidelity of Ghana's GIFTS program is strengthened by its supply chain, acceptability, and motivated stakeholders; however, training, curricula, clear communication, and incentives could improve it.",2,2,Nutrition & Dietetics

We report on findings of comparative data analysis based on 75 right-handed male high school students (16 -aEuro parts per thousand 18 years old) divided into four research groups designed by a combination of EM and G factors. Effects of EM factor appeared at the behavioral and electrophysiological levels. The fifth group of participants included 9 students with extraordinary mathematical abilities (S-MG: super mathematically gifted). We found that in EM participants, the G factor has no impact on the performance associated with translation between representations of the functions. The highest overall electrical activity is found in excelling in mathematics students who are not identified as generally gifted (NG-EM students). This increased electrical activity can be an indicator of increased cognitive load in this group of students. We identified accumulative and unique characteristics of S-MG at the behavioral and electrophysiological levels. We explain the findings by the nature of the tasks used in the study.

This contrasts with two alternatives in existing literature: the case presentation as an instance of pedagogically oriented supervision and legitimate peripheral participation; and as representative of professional discourse more generally. We make our case for re-framing the case presentation in relation to video and audio data generated within a study of an Accident and Emergency department in the UK.

This cross-sectional study compared the University of Massachusetts Memorial Medical Center patient claims data and body donation data from the UMMS Anatomical Gift Program (AGP). This study examined age, race, sex, and morbidities within a 10-year timeframe in 401,258 patients and 859 anatomical donors who met inclusion criteria. An independent t test was conducted to compare the mean ages of the two populations. Chi square analysis was conducted on race, sex, and 10 morbidity categories. A Fischer's exact test was conducted for two morbidity categories with n<10. Demographic analysis showed a significant difference in age, and racial representation between the populations. No statistical difference was found regarding sex. Morbidities were separated into 22 ICD-10 categories. Twelve categories were excluded and 10 were analyzed for population comparison. Two categories were over represented and seven were under-represented in the AGP population. One category showed no significant difference between populations. Targeted selection of cadavers in anatomy courses would improve morbidity variability in the anatomy lab. In addition, AGP acceptance guidelines should be evaluated to increase disease variation among the donor population. Clin. Anat. 31:250-258, 2018.

Additionally, it addresses the major issues of heterogeneous returns and endogeneity of educational attainment. Instrumental variable quantile regression along with other models is employed for that objective. The paper uses the most recent issues of the Harmonized Labor Force Survey and Egypt Labor Market Panel Survey from 2008 to 2018. The findings can be summarized as follows: the returns increase over time up to 2015 then decreases to reach 5.67% in 2018, a number that falls below the global average. Moreover, females' returns to education are higher than males; the returns are also higher in urban areas compared to rural ones providing an evidence that there exists developmental bias towards urban regions in Egypt. In line with preceding studies, the instrumental variable two-stage least squares estimates are higher than the ordinary least squares' estimates. Additionally, a confirmation of heterogeneous returns across the wage distribution is presented. The instrumental variable quantile regression estimates exhibit an increasing pattern across the levels of wages. Thus, the less able individuals gain lower marginal profits of education than do the more gifted employees. Indicating complementarity between education and unobservable characteristics and that education may aggravate wage inequality in Egypt. Furthermore, it confirms the presence of the over-education crisis.

Assessments were field tested in partner schools with high percentages of American Indian (97% to 100%) and Hispanic (83%) low-income students. Students were selected by considering their performance on all six assessments and were placed in internships along with students selected using conventional methods. Concept maps were successful: (a) students from partner schools demonstrated high levels of domain-relevant skills; (b) scores approximated a normal distribution; (c) scores of students from culturally diverse, low-income groups were very similar to the scores of students selected using conventional methods even though many of conventionally identified students had high grade point averages and came from schools in high-income areas with many educational opportunities. Students completed original research and presented posters to the university community and their local communities. Concept maps can be used alone or in combination with other assessments; their use needs to be studied with larger groups of students and in other contexts.",7,7,Education & Educational Research

This requires using inclusive approaches to teach CT to a wide spectrum of students. However, strategies for teaching CT to students with exceptionalities are not well studied. Objective: This study draws on lessons learned in two fourth-grade classrooms - one an inclusive general education classroom including students with and without disabilities, the other an inclusive GATE classroom including students with and without giftedness - to illustrate how CT frameworks can inform inclusive CS instruction. Method: A comparative case study design integrating content analysis and first and second cycle coding of data was used to analyze teachers' instructional strategies using a CT framework. Data included transcriptions of audio-recorded classroom lessons, field notes, and conversations with teachers and students. Findings: While each teacher used different strategies, both were effective in developing students' CT. Explicit instruction provided students receiving special education services with needed structure for the complex tasks inherent to computing. Peer feedback facilitated independent computational practice opportunities for students receiving GATE. Implications: This study highlights how inclusive instructional practices can be assessed using a CT framework and leveraged to maximize learning and access to CT curricula for learners with exceptionalities.",4,4,Education & Educational Research

As such, unique partnerships have started to emerge between science and education in an ongoing effort to capture the interest and imaginations of students as they make sense of the world around them. One such partnership is called the student-teacher-scientist partnership, in which teachers and their students participate in and contribute to the research of scientists. This article explores a partnership between a 10th-grade biology teacher, her students, and practicing scientists who collaborated in the design, implementation and evaluation of a horse evolution unit. The primary goal of the collaborative activity was to involve teachers and students in a process of conceptual change as a means of eliminating common misconceptions implicit in horse evolution displays in museums in various parts of the country. The evidence-based lessons developed enhanced students' understanding of concepts in macroevolution but also connected the science classroom with a community of scientists whose personalization of the horse evolution unit situated biological concepts and the learning experience within the context of real-world issues.",6,6,Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Education & Educational Research

The Eye Tracking is an advanced technology method that can be applied in research in many ways. The principle of this technology is in monitoring the human eye movements over the places what the eye is looking at during a given moment, it is focused on a distance or a time period when an object is monitored. The recording and analysing the course of view, the sequence of fixation of the eye and the eye movements also have an extensive use in cognitive sciences. The Gazepoint eye-tracker is currently one of the most accessible technology systems that monitor eye movements of its users. The essence of the study was to find out how the students proceeded in monitoring assignments displayed on the screen, how they continued working with the assignments, and whether the layout of the schematics, tables and applied images affected students` correctness for the solution. The main aim of the research was to find some similar segments in the experimental data and obtain clusters that would suggest a similar approach of the problem solved by students respondents, and to find out if - and possibly how - some strategies in the assignments differ at the talented students from the standard pupil population and compare the outcomes with students' characteristics. For both groups of students, some basic measures are proposed to increase the efficiency of student`s work with an assignment displayed on a computer screen. Thanks to these outcomes, we were able to attain the conclusion that the Eye Tracking is a proper experimental method which we would like to use e.g. for research of gifted students.

However, there have been few reports on this issue from East Asia. We aimed to investigate Japanese medical students' interactions with and attitudes toward the pharmaceutical industry, and to assess the correlation between exposures to a formal curriculum on drug promotion and perceptions of the appropriateness of the physician-industry relationship.MethodWe invited all 80 medical schools in Japan to participate. A cross-sectional anonymous survey was administered to medical students and school staff at the 40 schools that participated. The questionnaire for students assessed interactions with and attitudes toward the pharmaceutical industry. The questionnaire for school staff assessed the formal undergraduate curriculum.ResultsForty of the 80 medical schools in Japan participated. The response rate to the medical student survey was 74.1%, with 6771 evaluable responses. More than 98% of clinical students had previously accepted a small gift of stationery, a brochure, or lunch, and significantly higher percentages of clinical than preclinical students had accepted one or more gifts (P<.001). Among preclinical and clinical students, respectively, 62.7 and 71.9% believed it was appropriate to accept stationery, and 60.5 and 71.0% thought that attending an industry-sponsored lunch did not influence clinical practice. Of the 40 participating schools, 13 (33.0%) had a formal curriculum on drug promotion. A multivariate analysis showed an association between exposure to a formal curriculum and students' perceptions of the appropriateness of the physician-industry relationship only for gifts of stationery, which were perceived as inappropriate (OR: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.69-0.95, P=.02).ConclusionsMost Japanese medical students interact with the pharmaceutical industry and believe that gift acceptance is appropriate and not influential.

Historically, human embryos and fetal cadavers were used in anatomy education to understand development and congenital malformations. Recently, three-dimensional printed models produced from archival fetal specimens, and online repositories of images from archival collections of embryos and fetuses, have been used as an educational tool in human development courses. Given that the archival specimens were likely obtained prior to the era of informed consent, this raises questions about their appropriate and ethical use. Because some institutions in the United States retain archival collections of embryonic and fetal specimens that were once used as educational tools, their existence and utility require frequent reexamination against contemporary ethical frameworks to guide appropriate use or utilization. Four ethical rationales for uses of these collections are examined, including destruction, indefinite storage, use in research, and use in health professions education. Guidelines for the use of archival collections of human embryos and fetuses are presented. Indefinite storage and use in health professions education are supported, while use in research is also permitted, however, such use is limited and dependent on circumstance and purpose. The development of current digital repositories and three-dimensionally printed models based on archival collections that were collected without informed consent, or those promoting commercial opportunity, are not supported.

The using of authentic sources suggests that in the early years of the university's creation, the participation of women in the museum science was limited to charity. Women donated collections of their deceased relatives to Tomsk University or donated their own collections of museum objects. It is known about the generous gift of F.E. Tsibulskaya, Siberian gold-miner' widow. She donated a collection of Siberian minerals to the university. Anna Nordenschild (Smit), the widow of the Norwegian collector Gustav Nordenschild, presented a large collection of butterflies. It was highly appreciated by the head of the University Zoological Museum, professor Kashchenko. It mentioned that among the women-donors were ordinary townswomen, and high-society ladies. For example, the collection of coins and tokens, sent to Tomsk by E.V. von Geyser, the Minister of Public Education I.D. Delyanov had accompanied. The situation was changed by the law of July 3, 1914. This law allowed women to work in university museums on equal terms with men. The implementation of the law began in 1915. The Ministry of Public Education sent additional assignation for the maintenance of educational and auxiliary institutions (offices, laboratories, museums) of the Imperial Tomsk University. In 1915-1916, the first female employees were admitted to the museums of Tomsk University. Graduates of the Siberian Women's Courses Taisiya Tripolitova, Enafa Nikitina and Lidia Sergiyevskaya worked at the Botanical Museum (Herbarium)) on a permanent basis. They participated in scientific expeditions conducted under the leadership of professor of Botany Department V.V. Sapozhnikov, as well as the curator of the Botanical Museum P.N. Krylov. They processed their herbariums, published the first scientific articles. Elizaveta Kiseleva, a graduate of the Siberian Women's Courses, worked at the Zoological Museum. Under the guidance of Professor M.D. Ruzsky, she collected a collection of ants and was engaged in the processing and description of this collection. In 1919, E.F. Kiseleva collaborated at the Institute of Siberian Studies. She studied the fauna of the Ob River and brought a collection of Ob fish to the Zoological Museum. So the study of the causes of the fish kill in Ob River was began. In addition to full-time employees in Tomsk University museums female students who specialized in the study of Siberian vegetation worked as well. Their collections replenished the Herbarium of Tomsk University and were used for scientific and educational purposes.

The author proceeds from the statement that the need to form a sustainable lexical skill is defined objectively due to the increasing requirements for school graduates. In order to create all the necessary conditions for achieving results, it is important to optimize the learning process. The system-activity approach includes the education and development of the personal qualities of students; identification of individual features of gifted schoolchildren; focus on the result of training, taking into account the conscious choice of specialized subjects; the presence of cognitive motivation among students, including the improvement of practical language skills; various forms of organization that stimulate the development of creativity; introduction to the curriculum to solve problems, necessary in future professional life. An attempt was made to find out how effective the set of certain exercises is, which, being the basis of the learning system, is characterized by scientific, communicative orientation, as well as mutual, consistency, availability of exercises and repetition of language material and speech actions at all stages of work on the lexical component of language literacy of students, particularly, the formation of the mental lexicon of natural science discourse. Gural S.K. considers discourse as a result of the synthesis of scientific thought, as a super-complex formation consisting of multi-level components that interact with each other according to certain established rules in a certain social situation. Among the basic categories of the semantic content of discourse, Gural S.K. added and analyzed another category - the mental lexicon, which contributes to the teaching of foreign-language discourse as a super-complex self-developing system. The mental lexicon is not a dictionary with a fixed number of words and data for each unit. In synergetic logic, it is an active living system where new connections are constantly being established. Synergetic means working together or interacting cooperatively. Education is a field of activity that gives schoolchildren the opportunity to learn how to use modern technology in the learning process and make an informed choice of the future profession. In the current environment, there is a need in the school education system to implement a modular course structure based on a system approach. The main reason for the growing interest in a modular systemic approach is that modern schooling does not fully meet the needs of the individual and society in terms of social and personal identity, future professional flexibility. Using action-oriented approach, the learners are responsible for their own learning. The need to apply the language that emerged while fulfilling the communicative tasks makes learning process effective and the learner active. Action-oriented approach considers the learner as a social agent in classroom where learning is a social learning environment and develops linguistic and pragmatic skills besides communicative skills. The creation of social language environment where the learner will be able jointly communicate with each other in natural science environment depends on teachers' skills and knowledge. The tasks in classroom or out of classroom must interrelate the needs of the learners. This article highlights the results of the experimental preparation of modular English courses developed on the interactive educational platforms. Using course materials, teachers have the opportunity to develop gifted learners lexical skills in accordance with the individual needs, interests and abilities of senior schoolchildren. The study conducted by the author was attended by high school students of the Specialized Educational Scientific Center of NSU of a natural science profile. Control and pilot teams were organized from these senior schoolchildren. Classes in the control group were carried out according to the traditional content of foreign language instruction using Spotlight and Starlight course books. Foreign language classes in the experimental group of students were conducted using vocabulary exercises on natural science course content so that students could develop communication skills in basic activities in English and meet individual profile students' paths. The experimental educational process was built on combination of traditional and e-learning technologies. Exercises and activities which are common in vocabulary teaching / learning: word memorizing, using synonym and antonym words, deriving new words, matching words, finding-inventing word, various word games, task completion, action project realization. Based on the above, the author concludes that the integration of Action-Oriented Approach, and modular technology into the content of foreign-language education of high school students of a specialized school is justified by the new requirements of the Educational Standard for school graduates, but is also logical from the point of view of the approach aimed at developing the student's mental lexicon of natural science discourse in active, versatile and independent cognitive activity.",0,0,Linguistics

While recognizing the contradictory roles these intermediaries play in both facilitating and controlling migration and the porous boundary between for-profit and non-profit actors, scholars have yet to explore what challenges these characteristics pose to the organization of a particular brokerage transaction. How do these intermediaries reconcile their roles as migration facilitators and surrogate gatekeepers? Does it matter to present the transaction as driven by financial rewards or other loftier goals? How are the boundaries between different types of intermediaries enacted and contested? I explore these questions through the case of a religious organization that helps migrants establish their religious identities for asylum claims-making on religious grounds. Combining insights from the relational work approach with ethnographic research in Korean evangelical congregations in the U.S., I show how the template of gift giving allows the church to focus on making the faithful as God's intermediary, instead of screening them as the state's private deputy, and avoid an accusation that its trade with asylum-seekers turns the Christian persona into a quasi-commodity. The boundary between the church and commercial brokers, between gift giving and market exchange, however, is constantly contested and renegotiated through the interaction between the transaction parties. In conclusion, I discuss how the relational work approach can advance our comparative inquiry into the brokerage transactions facilitating the profane exchange of sacred identities for migration and citizenship purposes.",1,1,Sociology

In some insects that overwinter as adults, mating occurs both before and after overwintering. Two hypotheses have been proposed to explain the adaptive significance of pre-overwintering copulation of females. One is the bet-hedging hypothesis, which explains pre-overwintering copulation as a preparation for less chance of mating in the following spring. The other is the nuptial gift hypothesis, which states that secretions derived from males increase overwintering success of females. 2. In Eurema mandarina, both diapause autumn- and non-diapause summer-form male adults emerge with autumn-form female adults in the last generation in a year. Most autumn-form females mate with summer-form males before winter, and re-mate with autumn-form males in the following spring. Because autumn-form females have sufficient chances for mating after overwintering, the nuptial gift hypothesis has been regarded as the more probable hypothesis. 3. To test the nuptial gift hypothesis, the survival period was compared under short-day conditions at 10 degrees C between mated and unmated females that had been reared on sucrose solution at 25 degrees C for 15-21days. The mated females had significantly greater longevity than the unmated females, supporting the nuptial gift hypothesis. Body size also affected the survival period. 4. The results suggest that the nuptial gift is an important factor for the evolution of pre-overwintering copulation in species in which females mate both before and after overwintering.",2,2,Entomology

When interdisciplinary projects and real-world problems are combined students are required to use their creativity, academical knowledge and exert interdisciplinary thinking. To develop students' talents creating community and offer freedom of choice in their ways of working are seen as very beneficial. The Children's Congress connects these aspects aiming at inspiring students to work with computational thinking in different subjects as well as promoting the concept of working in an interdisciplinary way. In this project teachers, university students, and students from primary or secondary school work together to develop a digital product. In this process the students slip into the role of researchers and scientist. This paper provides an overview of the pedagogical concept behind the Children's Congress and the evaluation connected to the implementation of the three pillars of honors education. For this, different studies were conducted including interviews and questionnaires with school students, university students, and teachers participating in the project. This paper focuses on the results found in the questionnaires from the supporting university students and teachers and connects them with previous findings. It is shown that the Children's Congress includes all pillars of honors education and that this concept was experienced as very beneficial for both school- and university students as well as for teachers. Moreover, the Children's Congress was seen as a good opportunity to strengthen creative computational thinking and to support students in their talent development.",0,0,Computer Science; Education & Educational Research

The Early Generations of University Women in Fiction,OXFORD GERMAN STUDIES,New Woman; Education; Feminism; Fiction; Turn-of-the-century; Interwar years; Germany; Switzerland,EMANCIPATION,"The figure of the female student epitomized, for many German-speaking writers around 1900, the intellectual and social freedom supposedly enjoyed by the New Woman. After World War One, these freedoms were more likely to be represented by a white-collar worker or woman in public life, with university now being just one of the many possibilities beyond the domestic sphere. This comparative study of texts by women about female scientists examines how far the figure of the Akademikerin had lost her radical potential by the interwar era. The examples of pre-war fiction considered here (Aimee Duc's Sind es Frauen? and Ilse Frapan's Arbeit) foreshadow the politics of location as practised in the academy in the late twentieth century by questioning hierarchies, challenging women's outsider status, and carving out new space for collective endeavours. By contrast, in the two novels from the interwar era (Grete von Urbanitzky's Eine Frau erlebt die Welt and Vicki Baum's Stud. chem. Helene Willfuer), the scientific setting serves mostly to heighten the presentation of a gifted woman in the male domain' of science. Earlier prejudices about female students are reprised as a foil for the clever, life-affirming heroine, yet her emancipatory potential may be undermined by the ultimate emphasis on her maternal instinct.",0,0,Literature

Based on data set from a large commercial bank in China, this study measures credit card overspending behavior using consumption amount, cash withdrawal amount and overdueness, and suggests that gift acquisition has a positive effect on cash withdrawal amount and overdue probability as well as a negative effect on consumption amount. Furthermore, we find that this relationship could be weakened for female customers and for customers with higher education levels.

To study whether a worker's own promise of effort level governs his real choice of effort in a gift exchange game, we implement four treatments in our experiments by varying two factors: (1) who (the firm or the worker) takes the position of the proposer to propose the contract and (2) whether the proposed contract includes a nonbinding specification of the worker's effort level. Our key finding is that when it is the worker who proposes the contract and the contract includes the worker's promised effort level, both the worker's actual effort choice and the aggregate profits are significantly higher than in each of the other three treatments (and there is little difference in worker effort otherwise).

How science selects for perseverance and sociability at the expense of intelligence and creativity,MEDICAL HYPOTHESES,,ACADEMIC-PERFORMANCE; REVOLUTIONARY SCIENCE; PERSONALITY-FACTORS; SELF-DISCIPLINE; PSYCHOTICISM; ACHIEVEMENT; PREDICTORS; IQ,"Question: why are so many leading modern scientists so dull and lacking in scientific ambition? Answer: because the science selection process ruthlessly weeds-out interesting and imaginative people. At each level in education, training and career progression there is a tendency to exclude smart and creative people by preferring Conscientious and Agreeable people. The progressive lengthening of scientific training and the reduced independence of career scientists have tended to deter vocational 'revolutionary' scientists in favour of industrious and socially adept individuals better suited to incremental 'normal' science. High general intelligence (IQ) is required for revolutionary science. But educational attainment depends on a combination of intelligence and the personality trait of Conscientiousness; and these attributes do not correlate closely. Therefore elite scientific institutions seeking potential revolutionary scientists need to use IQ tests as well as examination results to pick-out high IQ 'under-achievers'. As well as high IQ revolutionary science requires high creativity. Creativity is probably associated with moderately high levels of Eysenck's personality trait of 'Psychoticism'. Psychoticism combines qualities such as selfishness, independence from group norms, impulsivity and sensation-seeking; with a style of cognition that involves fluent, associative and rapid production of many ideas. But modern science selects for high Conscientiousness and high Agreeableness: therefore it enforces low Psychoticism and low creativity. Yet my counter-proposal to select elite revolutionary scientists on the basis of high IQ and moderately high Psychoticism may sound like a recipe for disaster, since resembles a formula for choosing gifted charlatans and confidence tricksters. A further vital ingredient is therefore necessary: devotion to the transcendental value of Truth. Elite revolutionary science should therefore be a place that welcomes brilliant, impulsive, inspired, antisocial oddballs - so long as they are also dedicated truth-seekers.

The program, Engineering Education Experience (E3) was developed at Kansas State University, a midwestern university with a comprehensive engineering college. The program was created to support the University Engineering Initiative Act (UEIA). The UEIA, approved by the Kansas Legislature in 2011, provides funding for the state's three engineering colleges to increase the number of engineering graduates in the state. In support of this plan, Kansas State University College of Engineering created E3 to inform 6-12 teachers, administrators and counselors of engineering as a topic of study and career path with the intent of reaching middle and high school students. The program was offered to teachers as a summer professional development workshop. During the summer of 2012, the Kansas State University College of Engineering hosted two 3-day engineering education workshops for teachers. Topics of lessons and activities included (a) engineering design, (b) problem-solving, (c) biological and environmental engineering, (d) nanomaterials, and (e) wind power. Activities and discussions allowed teachers to extend their knowledge of STEM topics and to meet with College of Engineering administrators, faculty, and students. Sixty-six teachers, counselors, and administrators participated in the E3 workshops. Participants included middle and high school math, physical science, biological science, and gifted teachers, along with counselors and administrators. Participants received 20 hours of professional development credit. A pre-workshop survey assessed their existing knowledge of engineering and what they hoped to learn from the workshop. Participants also completed a post workshop evaluation survey. A majority of the responses were favorable to the E3 workshop, with 98.5% of participants rating overall quality of the presenters/sessions as very good or excellent. Participants indicated satisfaction in presentations of the many areas and applications of engineering, variety of programs, and careers associated with engineering, and engineering-related activities for the classroom.

A survey was carried out on different groups of anatomy students that were exposed and not yet exposed to human remains. The survey was used to record basic demographic data from the respondents, ask if they would support the establishment of an anatomy commemoration and in which format. A total of 756 anatomy students participated in the survey (response rate 69.8%). The majority (76.3%) were in favor of introducing a commemoration for donors. The associations of students' gender, attitude toward body donation, and level of exposure to human remains with attitudes toward commemoration for donors were identified (P < 0.05), whereas ethnicity and religion seemed to have no influence on attitudes (P > 0.05). Most students believed that anatomy staff and students should organize the commemoration. There was a preference for the commemoration to be secular with revealed identities of donors, and not recorded for social media. The support for the establishment of commemorations transcended cultural and religious differences and confirmed students' respectful attitude toward donors. Anatomy commemorations seem to have potential not only to engage students with one another, and donor families, but also to pave the way for students to become life-long ethical and empathetic learners and practitioners.",7,7,Education & Educational Research

Although typically occurring between routinecase oriented institutions vs. idiosyncratic-case oriented clients, such a struggle displays also the 'paradoxical injunctions' that frame teachers' everyday work: adopting a 'group-oriented' perspective while at the same time being accountable for an individualized approach.",3,3,Linguistics

Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two people share a computer and jointly develop a program. One of the programmers, the driver, operates the keyboard and mouse; the other, the navigator, reviews the code and helps without touching the keyboard or mouse. These two roles are swapped at regular intervals. Video data were collected during a half-day robotics workshop for students in Grades 5-9 (10-14 years old) and gifted students in Grades 3-6 (8-11 years old) at the University of Teacher Education Lucerne. A total of 203 pairs with different gender compositions (homogeneous female, homogeneous male, heterogeneous) were filmed during the pair programming process. Without consideration of the grade level the research results showed that there were no significant differences between the pairs based on gender composition in terms of task-solving speed, number of assistance requests, role changes, or rule violations by the navigator. In heterogeneous pairs, male and female students in the navigator role intervened equally often. These results initially appear to be consistent with several previous studies, which also found no significant differences based on gender composition. However, when only students in Grades 7-9 (12-14 years old) were considered, there were two significant differences. First, the homogeneous male pairs violated the rule that the navigator does not touch the keyboard or mouse more often than the other pairs. This suggests that homogeneous male pairs are not ideal for students in Grades 7-9 (12-14 years old). Second, as previously shown in other studies, heterogeneous pairs showed the greatest variability in task-solving speed. This may indicate compatibility issues among some heterogeneous pairs in Grades 7-9. In this study, only quantitatively measurable indicators of collaboration were considered. Further research on gender and pair programming should therefore focus on the quality of collaboration.",0,0,Education & Educational Research

Except for the LMA level, the FT1 and FT2 had a similar diet formulation. In FT1, LMA was included at 0 (basal diet), 1, 4, 8, 16 and 32gkg(-1), respectively. After 20weeks, daily weight gain and feed conversion ratio were improved but not differentiated with 1-8gkg(-1) LMA. Further increasing the LMA supply initially decreased the feed intake (16gkg(-1)), and then decreased both feed intake and feed utilization (32gkg(-1)), thus impairing the fish growth. FT2 was subsequently conducted with a smaller LMA range (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 8gkg(-1), respectively) but was unfortunately terminated at the end of 8weeks because 20% of the fish were badly injured during weighing. Unexpectedly, growth and feed utilization were still improved but not differentiated with 0.5-8gkg(-1) LMA. In FT2, beneficial effects of LMA inclusion on the digestive function (pepsin, foregut amylase and foregut lipase), the activities of serum lysozyme and hepatic superoxide dismutase, and liver lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde concentration) were found. Taking the results of FT1 and FT2 together, it could be concluded that dietary LMA supplementation at low concentrations (0.5-8gkg(-1)) could improve growth and feed utilization, but excess LMA (16gkg(-1)) might compromise feed intake and/or feed utilization, thus impairing fish growth. To reduce feed costs in commercial practice, 0.5gkg(-1) LMA is recommended in the feed of juvenile GIFT tilapia based on the results of this study.",7,7,Fisheries; Marine & Freshwater Biology

This study investigates the relationship between ADHD and academic performance in students with ADHD (n = 87), students with subclinical ADHD (n = 23), and matched comparisons (n = 112), accounting for exceptional student education (ESE) status. Academic outcomes included reading and math scores on a state-mandated achievement test, the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test (FCAT), grade point averages, retention, and graduation. Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses were conducted, adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics and ESE, to test ADHD status as an independent outcome predictor. Students with ADHD received more special education services (53%) than subclinical (26%) and comparison (10%) students (p < .01). ADHD was associated with poorer academic performance on all outcome measures, but only when ESE status was not accounted for. In the longitudinal analysis students with ADHD and special education needs consistently achieved lower FCAT scores than peers in the comparison group but showed comparable learning gains, or slopes, over time. Students without special education needs and gifted students with ADHD had comparable achievement and learning gains as comparison students of the same ESE status. Results suggest that special education status is a driving factor in underachievement among students with ADHD.",28,28,Education & Educational Research; Psychology

Trust building has attracted significant research interest, and gift giving has been shown to be one of its main drivers. Nonetheless, the mechanism of gift giving in the formation of trust networks and the channels through which gift giving and trust affect cooperation require further investigation. In this paper, we first separate social trust into community trust and personal trust, and we examine how gift giving affects the formation of each level of trust. We then explore how trust and gift giving affect rural households' access to formal and informal sources of credit. Our results show that gift giving mainly helps in forming trust at the personal level rather than the community level. In turn, personal and community trust can facilitate access to informal and formal sources of credit, respectively. In addition, personal trust facilitates access to informal loans for consumption and medical expenses but not production. Overall, our findings show that gift giving is mainly used to build personal trust which facilitates access to informal lending for risk-sharing purposes.",0,0,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology

In this paper we identify two prominent strands of policy in the government's approach to access and the widening of participation and contrast these with a third, more progressive perspective. The academic strand seeks to attract 'gifted and talented' young people into an unreformed higher education system. The second strand, which we term the utilitarian approach, posits a need for reform. However, this is undertaken largely to meet the requirements of employers and the economy. In contrast, a transformative approach values diversity and focuses on creating a system of higher education that does not place the burden of change upon potential entrants. This framework is used to explore some of the implications of the government's White Paper The future of higher education. First, the purpose of higher education is discussed, with particular reference to the distinction between economic and social objectives. Second, the government's view of the structure of the higher education sector is examined, by scrutinizing the notion of institutional differentiation and the role of the access regulator. We conclude that within a more differentiated higher education sector different aspects of the access discourse will become dominant in different types of institutions.",61,62,Education & Educational Research

The GIFT strain of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) has been selected for high-breeding values for body weight, whereas the Control was contemporaneously maintained and selected for breeding values of body weight close to the population mean. The Red tilapia (Oreochromis spp) was unselected at the time of the experiment. There were a total of 6000 fish at stocking in the study (2000 fish per genetic group). During the grow-out period of 147days, within each genetic group, the fish were randomly assigned to either a 28% or a 34% protein diet. Survival rate during grow-out averaged 72%. A total of 4335 fish were harvested, with individual body measurements and survival recorded. The effect of genetic group accounted for the largest proportion of variation in body weight and survival, followed by sex and protein level. Across the two dietary protein levels, the GIFT strain had the highest growth. The difference in body weight between the Control and Red tilapia was not statistically significant (P>0.05). Responses in growth to dietary protein levels also differed between genetic groups. No differences (P>0.05) in body weight were found in the GIFT selection and Control fish fed 28% or 34% protein diets. However, body weight of Red tilapia was greater in the high- than in the low-protein diet. In contrast to body weight, survival rate from stocking to harvest was affected by protein level. The high-protein diet significantly improved survival rate, averaging 24% across the three strains. The overall results indicate significant effects of genetic group and dietary protein level on both body weight and survival rate; however, the interaction between strain and dietary protein levels was small and possibly unimportant for these traits. It is concluded that the 28% protein diet used in the selection programme for the GIFT strain results in the selection of genotypes that can perform well under commercial feeds.",11,11,Fisheries

Results indicate that high levels of academic entrepreneurship in a scientific field are associated with less reliance on the gift-giving form of sharing (i.e., generalized exchange) traditionally recommended by scientific communities, and with a greater emphasis on direct benefits for givers (i.e., direct exchange), as well as a lower overall frequency of sharing. We observe these shifts in sharing behavior even among individual scientists who are not themselves entrepreneurially active; this suggests a general shift in scientific norms contingent on institutional contexts. These findings reflect contradictions inherent in current science policies that simultaneously encourage open science as well as commercial application of research results, and they suggest that the increasing emphasis on commercial activity may fundamentally change the normative structure of science.",37,37,Sociology

In this paper, the mating behavior of Dicerapanorpa magna (Chou) was investigated to reveal the role of the anal horns (a pair of posterior processes on tergum VI) of males. The males initiate copulation through grasping the female with the notal organ and anal horns, prolonging copulation by providing salivary masses to the female as nuptial gifts and maintaining copulation after the female consumed the salivary masses. The results of a manipulative experiment show that the anal horns play a significant role in the mating success for the males of D.magna by promoting male domination in copulation through increasing the duration of pre- and post-gift-providing copulatory stages against female resistance and by avoiding wasting of nuptial gifts.

Concomitantly, the mRNA levels of glycolytic genes, such as hexokinase 1a (hk1a), hk1b, glucokinase and liver type of phosphofructokinase, were upregulated. The expression of glycogen synthase 1 and glycogen level in the AT increased between 3 and 8 HAF, suggesting that AT has the capacity to store excess glucose in tilapia. The decreased glycogen level together with upregulated transcription of glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit a2 (g6pca2) at 24 HAF suggests that glycogen breakdown and glucose release from AT might contribute to circular glucose in tilapia. The opposite expression patterns between g6pca2 and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (pck) paralogs suggest that pck might participate in glyceroneogenesis rather than gluconeogenesis in the AT of tilapia. The mRNA levels of both cytosolic pck1 and mitochondrial pck2 increased during the period 1-8 HAF, and the expressions of lipogenic genes, such as acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthase, were upregulated between 3 and 8 HAF, suggesting that glyceroneogenesis was probably stimulated as a source of glyceride-glycerol for triglyceride synthesis in the AT of tilapia. Taken together, our preliminary data suggest that AT plays an important role in the regulation of postprandial glucose homeostasis in the omnivorous tilapia, at least at the molecular level.",2,3,Fisheries

Existing methods limited the diversity of students identified. Significant differences were found between students identified by the new methods (M2) and existing methods (M1) in GPA, ethnicity, and parent level of education. Ethnicity differences may be due to the ethnic makeup of the partner schools, but differences in GPA and parent level of education cannot be attributed to the location of schools. Although GPAs of M1 students were significantly higher (3.71) than those of M2 students (3.07) and M1 students came from higher income groups and schools in higher income areas, the M2 students scored higher on all the performance assessments of creative problem-solving and at similar levels on concept maps and mathematical problem-solving.

Moving to a team of workers introduces new motivations, such as free riding and coordination burden, that are likely to intensify with team size and the technology used by the firm. We find that the positive relationship between wages and effort, although affected, still holds; workers reduce their efforts when coordination for efficiency is more difficult using a particular production technology.

New data on the dating of some artefacts let assume that a number of shields, the production technology of which goes back to the Late Bronze Age or made later ( in the Geometric or Archaic Periods) may have been displayed in sanctuaries under the influence of the artifacts from the Late Bronze Age. The authors propose a version according to which Herodotus, describing the Croesus' gifts in Thebes, uses the word sigma alpha kappa omicron zeta, thereby emphasizing the uncommonness of the golden shield, its heroic antiquity and the reliability of the Amphiaraus' shield. Archaeological parallels and the words phi alpha epsilon nu alpha nu [alpha sigma pi]iota delta alpha from an inscription found in Thebes suggest that it was a round shield.

However, the functional morphology of this anal horn and the genitalia have not been studied to date. Herein, we investigated the functional morphology of the genitalia and the nongenital structures of the scorpionfly Cerapanorpa dubia by observing the mating process and dissecting the freeze-fixated pairs in copula to reveal the copulatory mechanism. The male C. dubia provides a solid salivary mass to the female as a nuptial gift prior to copulation. When the female starts to feed on the gift, the male uses his notal organ and complex genital structures to control the closest wing and genitalia of the female to establish a V-shaped mating position. In the maintenance phase of copulation, the male uses his anal horn in cooperation with the basally-constricted abdominal segment VII to clamp female abdominal segment VIII. The male hypovalves grasp female cerci, and move up and down rhythmically. The paired parameres clasp both sides of female tergite IX. The basal processes on male gonostyli grip the pleural membranes of the female genital chamber. In the sperm transfer phase, the male aedeagus directly couples with the female medigynium to transmit sperm by connecting his phallotreme to the female's copulatory pore.

Previous studies have suggested that a male, which carries food for use as nuptial gifts for females, performs the wing-waving behavior when the male gives the gift to a female or competes with other males. However, when and how the wing-waving behavior occurs during a series of nuptial giftings and male-male competitions have not been investigated. Therefore, we here observed the role of wing-waving behavior during the processes of giving nuptial gifts and male-male competition in the Japanese scorpionfly in the laboratory and field. Unlike previous studies, only males performed wing-waving behavior toward females, while females did not exhibit the behavior in the wild. Also, males always performed wing-waving behavior before male-male competition. After a male-male competition, winner males continued wing-waving behavior, but loser males never performed the behavior against the winner male. A comparison of wing-waving behaviors before competitions between winner and loser males showed that the frequencies of wing-waving behaviors were higher in winner than in loser males. The present results suggest that the wing-waving behavior functions in the inter-sexual and intra- sexual selection in P. japonica.

Methods: One hundred and forty-eight people with type 2 diabetes underwent a structured interview using a 32-item designed questionnaire (DiFoKaPS-32) about their knowledge of foot care standards in diabetes and their personal foot care behaviours. Each participant in the study received a single 20 min education session individually. The mode of the intervention was face-to-face. Results: The applied educational intervention aimed at patients with type 2 diabetes has improved their knowledge and practice about diabetic foot care (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.011; Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test, respectively). Knowledge and practice scores were increased significantly after the education in the lean group (BMI <= 25) rather than the obese ones. Conclusions: In conclusion the findings of our study have shown that a simple face-to-face education is an effective and applied method to improve the knowledge about foot care. It has also shown that it could increase the motivation and change the behaviour of people with type 2 diabetes regarding their feet. In addition, the obese patients referring to a diabetic clinic need much more attentions and tighter care programs. (C) 2009 Primary Care Diabetes Europe. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Despite being often feared, spiders are mysterious and intriguing, offering a useful foundation for the effective teaching and learning of scientific concepts and processes. In order to provide an entryway for teachers and students-as well as scientists themselves-into the biology of spiders, we compiled a list of 99 record breaking achievements by spiders (the Spider World Records). We chose a world-record style format, as this is known to be an effective way to intrigue readers of all ages. We highlighted, for example, the largest and smallest spiders, the largest prey eaten, the fastest runners, the highest fliers, the species with the longest sperm, the most venomous species, and many more. We hope that our compilation will inspire science educators to embrace the biology of spiders as a resource that engages students in science learning. By making these achievements accessible to non-arachnologists and arachnologists alike, we suggest that they could be used: (i) by educators to draw in students for science education, (ii) to highlight gaps in current organismal knowledge, and (iii) to suggest novel avenues for future research efforts.

This is no longer the case, and over recent decades science authorship has fundamentally changed its character. At one extreme, prestigious scientists writing from high status institutions are used as mere figureheads to publish research that has been performed, analyzed and 'ghost-written' by commercial organizations. At the other extreme 'quant bloggers' are publishing real science with their personal. identity shielded by pseudonyms and writing from internet addresses that give no indication of their location or professional affiliation. Yet the paradox is that while named high status scientists from famous institutions are operating with suspect integrity (e.g. covertly acting as figureheads) and minimal accountability (i.e. failing to respond to substantive criticism); pseudonymous bloggers - of mostly unknown identity, unknown education or training, and unknown address - are publishing interesting work and interacting with their critics on the internet. And at the same time as 'official' and professional science is increasingly timid careerist and dull; the self-organized, amateur realm of science blogs displays curiosity, scientific motivation, accountability, responsibility - and often considerable flair and skill Quant bloggers and other internet scientists are, however, usually dependent on professional scientists to generate databases. But professional science has become highly constrained by non-scientific influences: increasingly sluggish, rigid, bureaucratic, managerial, and enmeshed with issues of pseudo-ethics, political correctness, public relations, politics and marketing. So it seems that professional science needs the quant bloggers. One possible scenario is that professional scientists may in future continue to be paid to do the plodding business of generating raw data (dull work that no one would do unless they were paid); but these same professional scientists (functioning essentially as either project managers or technicians) may be found to lack the boldness, flair, sheer 'smarts' or genuine interest in the subject to make sense of what they have discovered. Some branches of future science may then come to depend on a swarm of gifted 'amateurs' somewhat like the current quant bloggers; for analysis and integration of their data, for understanding its implications, and for speculating freely about the potential applications.

One of the tasks for the group of instructors engaged in the project has been to achieve the constructions of diagrams using pencil and paper, which demonstrate the relations between the concepts of the theme on space polyhedral (important in the Curriculum), including characteristic of Euler, which furthermore lead to constructions of spatial polyhedral figures gluing colored paperboard patrons produced by children. Another theme, is concerned to combinatorial techniques related to probability concepts: here it was successful a collaborative work, where children were engaged in some game activities specially designed so that the motor and mental coordination could be developed. Also we suggest a series of experimental activities that help students to assimilate the concepts of probability through exploration and interpretations of combinatorial tree diagrams, teamwork using cards with digits, so that children could gradually develop different skills and activate cognitive resources that are necessary for problem solving.",0,0,Education & Educational Research

Health and well being of children is intimately linked with the health, nutrition, education and awareness of their mothers. In order to improve child health and survival, it is therefore important to provide a life-cycle approach for the care of girl children with focus on equal opportunities for their nutrition (from birth through infancy, childhood, adolescence, pregnancy and lactation), optimal health care, education, dignity, empowerment, status and say in society. Every child must be viewed in totality - body, mind, heart and soul, and not in isolation but in context with the dynamics of their ecology, family, friends, teachers and society. We should treat the child and not his disease or laboratory reports. And every contact with the family should be effectively harnessed to provide holistic care and not mere cure. We must give advice regarding life style changes, importance of personal hygiene, promotion of breast feeding, provision of safe environment, personal hygiene, optimal nutrition, immunizations and prevention of accidents. We should try to establish a rapport with the child and his parents to provide them emotionai support and win their faith, trust and confidence. We should make sincere efforts to become knowledgeable, upto-date and a rational physician to practice evidence-based pediatrics.

Presented in heterogeneous formats (printed, outlined on websites, or as images, podcasts and videos), they constitute exemplars of contemporary brand management. Based on a content and thematic analysis of online discourses that attempt to define the genre and of Apple's paradigmatic brand manifesto 'Here's to The Crazy Ones', in this article I aim at developing a comprehensive understanding of the form and content of contemporary brand manifestos. My findings demonstrate how brand manifestos recast traditional profit-oriented marketing practices by conjuncting the 'ideology of the gift' with discourses of the avant-garde. Following a 'gift logic' that can be viewed as fundamentally embedded into a 'brand logic', brand manifestos aim at manifesting the inalienable 'spirit of the brand' and at creating mutual relations of reciprocity by means of commercial exchange. Moreover, I argue that at a broader level the appropriation of the unconventional and creative connotations of the traditional manifesto form renders brand manifestos into a distinctive subgenre of a larger capitalist marketing discourse, premised on a revolutionary avant-gardist rhetoric that can be labelled as 'manifesto marketing'.",0,0,Arts & Humanities - Other Topics

First, we explore whether there are general cohort differences. Second, we examine how transfers have changed across four specific U.S. birth cohorts. We draw on ideas from research on cohort succession processes to document differences across cohorts in financial resources,and we draw on work on bequest behavior to address how resource differences might lead to cohort differences in transfers. Using the Survey of Consumer Finances, we find that members of younger cohorts are less likely than members of older cohorts to receive any transfer but that younger recipients receive larger transfers. We also find that members of younger cohorts are less likely to receive inheritances and trusts, more likely to receive inter vivos gifts, and less likely to inherit at any age than members of older cohorts. Our findings underscore the importance of birth cohorts in studies of inequality and suggest that wealth inequality may worsen over time given that a smaller number of people are receiving large transfers.",5,5,Sociology

Also, we examined the role of parental antecedents on students' beliefs. Participants were 3,329 seventh-grade students and their parents. Only being labeled as gifted was related to adopting a fixed mind-set. Regarding parental antecedents, parents' intelligence and effort beliefs were related to students' corresponding beliefs. Furthermore, parental feedback was associated with students' beliefs, which was most pronounced when student-reports of feedback were used. In particular, person-oriented feedback related positively to a fixed mind-set and negatively to students' appreciation of the role of effort in academic performance, while process-oriented feedback showed the opposite pattern.

However, it remains largely unknown how the length of the notal organ influences the nuptial feeding behaviour of Neopanorpa. Here, we investigated the nuptial feeding by comparing the morphology of mating-related structures and the genital coupling of a) Neopanorpa lui Chou & Ran, 1981 with a weakly-developed notal organ, b) N. carpenteri Cheng, 1957 with a medium-sized notal organ, and c) N. longiprocessa Hua & Chou, 1997 with an extremely elongated notal organ. The couples of N. lui and N. carpenteri maintain an intermittent mouth-to-mouth mode but do not exchange any edible food. After that the males secrete a salivary mass onto the surface as a nuptial gift, which is distinctly larger in N. carpenteri than in N. lui. Correspondingly, the male salivary glands are more developed in N. carpenteri than in N. lui. Males of N. longiprocessa bear very short salivary glands corresponding to a coercive mating tactic. The genital couplings are similar among the three species of Neopanorpa. The paired hypovalves of males are used to control the cerci of females. The prominent basal processes of male gonostyli grasp the posterior portion of the female medigynium across the intersegmental membrane. The male aedeagus physically couples with the female medigynium to ensure the male phallotreme to connect to the female copulatory pore. The influence of the notal organ length on the nuptial feeding behaviour of Neopanorpa is briefly discussed.",10,11,Zoology

Sub-adult fish (about 173 g) were sampled at 0, 1, 3, 8 and 24 h post feeding (HPF) after 36 h of food deprivation, and the time course of changes in intestinal glucose transport, glycolysis, glycogenesis and gluconeogenesis at the transcription and enzyme activity level, as well as plasma glucose contents, were analyzed. Compared with 0 HPF (fasting for 36 h), the mRNA levels of both ATP-dependent sodium/glucose cotransporter 1 and facilitated glucose transporter 2 increased during 1-3 HPF, decreased at 8 HPF and then leveled off. These results indicated that intestinal uptake of glucose and its transport across the intestine to blood mainly occurred during 1-3 HPF, which subsequently resulted in the increase of plasma glucose level at the same time. Intestinal glycolysis was stimulated during 1-3 HPF, while glucose storage as glycogen was induced during 3-8 HPF. Unexpectedly, intestinal gluconeogenesis (IGNG) was also strongly induced during 1-3 HPF at the state of nutrient assimilation. The mRNA abundance and enzyme activities of glutamic-pyruvic and glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminases increased during 1-3 HPF, suggesting that the precursors of IGNG might originate from some amino acids. Taken together, it was concluded that the anterior intestine played an important role in the regulation of postprandial glucose homeostasis in omnivorous tilapia, as it represented significant glycolytic potential and glucose storage. It was interesting that postprandial IGNG was stimulated by feeding temporarily, and its biological significance remains to be elucidated in fish.",13,13,Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics

Male adult fish were intraperitoneally injected with 1 g glucose/kg of body weight after 24 h of food deprivation, and then subjected to sampling at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6 and 12 h after the GTT. Compared with the control (4.3 mM/L), plasma glucose level peaked at 1 h (14.8 mM/L), decreased during 2-4 h (5.7-8.3 mM/L), and was restored after 6 h of the GTT. Although the expression of ins1, ins2 and ide were not affected in the Brockman body, plasma insulin level concomitantly increased with the increase of plasma glucose level during 1-4 h after the glucose injection. The expression of glucose transporter 1 sharply increased at 1 h after the GTT, indicating that hepatic glucose uptake was stimulated. The mRNA level of glucokinase was up-regulated during 1-4 h, and the activity of phosphofructokinase increased during 2-4 h, suggesting that hepatic glycolysis was active during 1-4 h after the glucose administration. The mRNA level of glycogen synthase 1 increased at 1 h, and liver glycogen level accumulated at 4 h after the GTT. Although the expression of glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit a2 was suppressed during 1-2 h, neither the mRNA level of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 2 nor its activity was impacted by the glucose injection, which might have prolonged the glucose clearance of tilapia. Hepatic lipogenesis was effectively stimulated to dispose excess glucose absorbed by the hepatocytes, as up-regulation of mRNA levels of ATP citrate lyase a (during 1-4 h), acetyl-CoA carboxylase alpha (during 4-12 h) and fatty acid synthase (during 2-12 h) were accompanied by the GTT.

In course of research the modem student is revealed to constantly use acquisition of the multimedia language of the screen, significantly complementing the textual educational content with visual images. The problems of modern education are described in the context of the potential of digital culture, where the student faces audio-visual environment. The assertion of digital socialization shapes a digital identity of Homo Digitalis, which independently creates and controls his own informal educational strategies, the implementation of which requires a new kind of literacy. Discovering the essence of the concept of literacy corresponding to its other narratives revealed the meaning and purpose of visual literacy. The importance of its separation is caused by the inherent for the digital society gap between verbal and visual cultures, the growth of experience of human interaction with the virtual environment.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the challenges educators faced during emergency remote learning so that others may learn from their experience. METHOD: A case study based on the experience of educators compares how education continuity was provided in Bahrain, Iraq, and Russia. Personal insights gathered using Zoom, complemented by documentary evidence, explore the 'lived experience' of the emergency changes made to teaching and learning provision. RESULTS: Whilst teachers and students were ill-prepared, and there were issues with electricity supply, stable Wi-Fi, and access to equipment, most countries were able to offer students access to learning using a combination of distance education and online learning. Benefits accrued were greater familiarity with the use of technology and a revaluing of the importance of social relations in teaching and learning. Early indications are that educational inequities may have been widened as a consequence.

First, the establishment of a land-grant university was an independent act by the US federal government that endowed specific counties across the country with a university. Second, their mission of inclusion, with an emphasis on the agricultural and mechanic arts, was designed to educate the industrial class for professional life. Despite these institutions' unique founding and mission, however, land-grant universities have received little specific attention in the broader literature on university impacts. Given the comparatively little attention devoted to these institutions, the goal of this study is to use a descriptive and exploratory quasi-experimental analysis to evaluate the potential impacts of land-grant institutions on their local communities. The results of this analysis suggest that land-grant universities do impact their local communities, but that these impacts did not begin to appear until approximately sixty years after their initial founding.",7,7,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public Administration

Flow regulations through structural barriers alter the geomorphic and hydraulic geometry of riverine habitats. Determining the ecological health of river habitats under the contemporary modification is detrimental to its restoration and management. This study evaluates reach averaged hydraulic habitat of the endangered Ganga River dolphin (Platanista gangetica) in a stretch between Bijnor and Narora barrages. We consider an optimal minimum flow depth as the determining factor of habitat suitability. Field measurement of the hydraulic geometry and flow characteristics show that the optimal flow depth is available in the study reach during the monsoon period, while in the pre-monsoon, the minimum depth is present only in the reach upstream to Narora barrage. We use a geomorphic instream flow tool (GIFT) and satellite altimeter water level data to simulate reach averaged hydraulic habitat in varying flow conditions in area upstream of Narora barrage. We observe that to maintain the minimum flow depth which supports the dolphin habitat in the study reach, an optimal discharge of about >280 m3s-1$$ >280\ {m}<^>3{s}<^>{-1} $$ is essential. Furthermore, we develop a water-level (altimeter) and discharge (simulated from GIFT) rating curve for the study reach. It can be used to get a first-order estimate of discharge for a given water level or vice versa. This study indicates that the altimetry datasets are good precursors for estimating averaged hydraulic habitat of rivers in the data-scarce regions.

This research introduces this concept of parental overvaluation. We developed a concise self-report scale to measure individual differences in parental overvaluation, the Parental Overvaluation Scale (POS; Study 1). The POS has high test-retest stability over 6, 12, and 18 months (Study 2). As demonstrated in a representative sample of Dutch parents (Study 3) and a diverse sample of American parents (Study 4), the POS has an internally consistent single-factor structure; strong measurement invariance across sexes; as well as good convergent, discriminant, and criterion validity. Overvaluation is especially high in narcissistic parents (Studies 3, 4, 6). When parents overvalue their child, they overclaim their child's knowledge (Study 4), perceive their child as more gifted than actual IQ scores justify (Study 5), want their child to stand out from others, and frequently praise their child in real-life settings (Study 6). By contrast, overvaluation is not consistently related to parents' basic parenting dimensions (i.e., warmth and control) or Big Five personality traits (Studies 3, 4, 6). Importantly, overvalued children are not more intelligent or better performing than other children (Studies 5-6). These findings support the validity of the POS and show that parental overvaluation has important and unique implications for parents' beliefs and practices. Research on overvaluation might shed light on the determinants of parenting practices and the socialization of children's self-views, including narcissism.",38,38,Psychology

In our experiment, a third of the houses in a town were covered by lava. People living in these houses were much more likely to move away permanently. For the dependents in a household (children), our estimates suggest that being induced to move by the lava shock dramatically raised lifetime earnings and education. While large, these estimates come with a substantial amount of statistical uncertainty. The benefits of moving were very unequally distributed across generations: the household heads (parents) were made slightly worse off by the shock. These results suggest large barriers to moving for the children, which imply that labour does not flow to locations where it earns the highest returns. The large gains from moving for the young are surprising in light of the fact that the town affected by our volcanic experiment was (and is) a relatively high income town. We interpret our findings as evidence of the importance of comparative advantage: the gains to moving may be very large for those badly matched to the location they happened to be born in, even if differences in average income are small.",12,12,Business & Economics

As such, our understanding of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias remains limited in these underrepresented and understudied populations. I Jere, we examine perceived impediments to completed brain autopsies among diverse older adults who have agreed to brain donation for clinical research. Methods: Participants (N=22) were older adults (mean age=77 years) who self-identified as African American (n=8), Latino (n=6), or White of lower income (n=8). All participants had previously agreed to brain donation via the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act. Each participant took part in a one-time, semi-structured focus group.

For the past four decades, the nation has seen the cost of tuition rise at levels that exceed inflation, and financial assistance rates that have not kept pace with that growth. Studies suggest that these financial resources play a role in influencing college attendance decisions and persistence for low-income students. This study examines the characteristics of zero-EFC students as compared to non-zero EFC students and determines the extent to which a gift-aid only, and gift-aid plus loans awards package affects the likelihood of persistence. Also, it explores the relationship between the ratio of loans-to-gift-aid, and the likelihood of persistence across income levels. By employing logistic regression, this study aims to determine if there are differential effects among financial aid award packages, and if the ratio of a loans-to-gift-aid package affects persistence by income status. Results demonstrated that a gift-aid only package, and a gift-aid plus loans package negatively influenced the enrollment outcomes of zero-EFC students and positively influenced the enrollment outcomes of high-income students. Additionally, when examining the ratio of loans-to-gift-aid for students with a gift-aid and loans package, results showed that the higher the ratio of loans to gift-aid, the higher the likelihood of persistence for all income levels. In an era where the rising costs of a college education are becoming more difficult to cover with present levels of financial aid, earning a higher education credential is possible if students are willing to take on educational debt. A comprehensive higher education plan that acknowledges financial barriers as fundamental obstacles to the college success of the lowest income students is necessary to preserving equal opportunity to upward social mobility.",2,2,Education & Educational Research

In recent years, fitness activities became the most common way to engage in physical activities. In this paper, we propose a smart-glove based fitness activity tracking system that can detect athletes activities in any indoor fitness facility, with no need of attaching multiple sensors on the athlete's body. The system adopts force sensitive resistor (FSR) sensors to identify the type of exercise by analyzing the pressure distribution in the hand palm during fitness activities. To evaluate the performance of our proposed system, we ran a pilot study with 10 healthy participants over 10 common fitness activities. The experimental results showed an overall recognition accuracy rate of 87%. We believe the promising results would contribute to the works on personal assisted coaching systems and create enjoyable experiences when performing fitness activities.",0,0,Computer Science; Telecommunications

NPGL plays a crucial role in monitoring energetic status via the regulation of feeding and metabolism. However, no study on NPGL has been reported in fish thus far. In the present study, the full-length cDNA of NPGL was identified from the hypothalamus of GIFT tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). The ORF of tilapia NPGL is 471 bp and encodes a precursor peptide with a size of 156 a.a, consisting of a 26 a.a signal peptide and an 82 a.a mature peptide. Tissue distribution profiles of npgl in tilapia were acquired using semiquantitative PCR and in situ hybridization (ISH). The results showed that the highest npgl mRNA is expressed in the telencephalic-preoptic complex, which comprises both the telencephalon and the anterior preoptic area (POA) of male tilapia, and in the ovary of female tilapia. In addition, in male tilapia, the ISH results showed that the cells containing npgl mRNA were distributed exclusively in the anterior periventricular pretectal nucleus (Ppa) of the POA. FISH results demonstrated that npgl mRNA is also expressed in the lateral tuberal nucleus of the hypothalamus (NLT). Real-time PCR showed that npgl mRNA significantly increased in the telencephalic-preoptic complex of male tilapia that were fasted for 24 h and then fed a full diet for 20 min compared with the unfed group. Results of the FISH study showed that parvocellular cells containing npgl mRNA in the Ppa of fed fish were apparently more abundant than those of the unfed group. Few npgl positive signals also appeared in the NLT after full feeding, where pomc mRNA is highly expressed. These results indicate that NPGL may be a short-term satiety factor in fish and that the coexpression of NPGL and POMC may be present in the hypothalamus of male tilapia.",1,1,Endocrinology & Metabolism; Zoology

The Department of Engineering Professional Development at the University of Wisconsin began developing ethics seminars and webinars to provide these credits to engineers in the state of Wisconsin. This paper explores several observations from talking with over 1000 practicing engineers in the past year. These include (1) that engineers typically do not use available professional codes of ethics when addressing ethical dilemmas; unsurprisingly, many instead employ what could be called common-sense ethics; (2) that organizational politics sometimes constrain discussion of case studies during these sessions; (3) that engineers in private and public sectors often carry differing views of the ethics of gift-giving; and (4) that experienced engineers, in particular, employ what could be called gut-check ethics that rely on intuition to determine right from wrong. We address the challenges these observations present and note opportunities for further analysis through study of the psychology of influence, motivated blindness, and cognitive biases. Regardless of the challenges we note here, it is clear that engineers place a high value on the opportunity to discuss case studies in ethics with other professional engineers, and when properly done, licensure training in ethics can provide a unique mentoring opportunity for the profession. Our existing PE seminar is a work in progress, and we hope this paper will initiate fruitful conversations about future directions as we develop an advanced seminar.",0,0,Computer Science; Social Sciences - Other Topics; History & Philosophy of Science

However, the trade-off between immunity and reproduction can be minimized when females have access to abundant nutrient resources. This observation suggests that the nuptial gifts provided by males in many insect systems may help to offset the common immunological cost to reproduction. In the present study, this hypothesis is tested in the ground cricket Allonemobius socius (Scudder), whose females receive a sizeable haemolymph-based gift. Accordingly, male gift donation is controlled by covering the tibial spur (the source of the gift) of randomly chosen males with clear nail polish. The influence of sperm transfer on female immunity is disentangled from that of the nuptial gift by also examining females who fail to receive sperm during mating (spermatophore transfer has a 40% failure rate in virgin males). It is predicted that females who receive a nuptial gift will exhibit superior immune function compared with those who receive no gift. The results show that sperm transfer reduces female immune function, which is an expected immunological cost of reproduction. By contrast to the prediction, nuptial gifts do not minimize the immunological cost of reproduction in this system. Unexpectedly, the receipt of a gift appears to decrease female immune function independent of sperm transfer. The findings suggest that the nuptial gift, similar to sperm, signals the female to begin her reproductive investment, causing limited resources to be reallocated from immune function.",3,3,Entomology

However, in low income countries like Zambia they often drop out of school due to poverty, early pregnancy and early marriages. Some studies indicate that economic support such as Social Cash Transfers (SCTs) can mitigate the effects of poverty on female adolescents by improving their school participation and helping postpone pregnancy and marriage. This study aimed to explore the role of economic support in influencing education and sexual decision making among female adolescents in a randomised controlled trial in Zambia. Methods: The study adopted a qualitative approach. It utilized purposive and convenient sampling. Data were collected from 6 schools using 18 in-depth interviews (IDIs) and 4 focus group discussions (FGDs) comprising 48 school-going female adolescents in grade 8 aged 14 to 17. All participants received economic support in form of SCTs and payment of school fees as part of the Research Initiative to Support the Empowerment of Girls (RISE), a Cluster Randomised Controlled Trial. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Results: Findings suggested several benefits of the economic support for the female adolescents such as economic independence and empowerment; increased assertiveness and autonomy; reduced desire for sexual relationships with boys in exchange for cash and gifts; increased motivation for school; enhanced parental and community support for female adolescents' education and; reduced school dropouts. However, they also experienced jealousy from those who did not benefit from the economic support.

With our system for identifying talented students we can detect general and specific abilities as well as creativity in the candidates. Our teaching experiences as secondary school and university teachers suggest that an effective way to consolidate and integrate the scientific knowledge students receive, is to have them write and present some chemistry and biochemistry works following the same rules as those for a scientific manuscript. There is growing interest among science teachers to include writing a scientific paper as an active educational approach. A science paper/manuscript should be written in a clear and concise style, its paragraphs should be logical and consistent, and its information should be well organized. Talented students review principles of effective writing, see examples of good and bad writing and also get tips to make the writing process easier (practical instructions on how to edit, clarity in communication, setting standards for scientific writing in journals and reflections on their own writing). Then, students work on the title, abstract, introduction, materials and methods, results, discussion, conclusion, acknowledgements and references of their scientific argument. Finally, talented students were asked whether this activity can help to improve biochemistry knowledge and they concluded that it is a helpful contribution to their science knowledge.

However, the performance of FBs under the formal care approach has not yet been studied. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the quantity of food donation (QFD) and the variety of food donation (VFD) of FBs in Korea. Design/methodology/approach - Aspects of quantity of donations, variety of donations, and changes in the number of donors and recipients for Korean FBs were considered. Regression analysis and the Herfindahl-Hirschman index were employed for the analysis, and data were collected through on-site interviews in Korea and online information. Findings - Korean FBs were initially based on the concept of gift exchanges, with the expectation of receiving something in return, and thus did not employ the concept of real gifts or charity. Moreover, Korean FB development was compelled, as this exchange was enacted into law. Therefore, the QFD increased rapidly post the legislation of FBs, a fact not observed in other countries. The authors verified that the QFD and VFD in Korea increased significantly within a decade due to the government intervention.

Conclusions The new findings indicate that swollen first metatarsal segments are relatively common in the family Orthophlebiidae during the Middle Jurassic. The tarsal swellings are considered to be sexually dimorphic, potentially associated with sexually display by males and/or camouflage of a nuptial gift in the mating process.",6,6,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity

Eight kindergartens from three district areas of Hefei City (a total of 1252 children aged 4-6 years and their parents) were randomly selected. Descriptive and analytical statistical methods were used to evaluate the baseline, midterm, and final western style fast food knowledge, attitude, and practice in both parents and children were used to identify and compare the knowledge, attitude, and practice in the parents and children. Parents and children were divided into intervention and control groups based on nutrition education status. Consumption of western style fast food at breakfast in Chinese children and parents is not high. The main reasons for this in children is that consumption of western style fast food is not viewed as food, but rather as a gift or interesting. The time of children's consumption of western style fast food is mostly likely to be in the weekends. The nutrition education modified the parents' western style fast food behavior (p < 0.01), although it did not change significantly in children. The healthy nutrition concept should be built up among Chinese, especially in children.

The authors note that advertising can be considered as information provided as a gift for potential customers. It supports production expansion and stimulates consumer spending. The concept of gift in advertising is defined as the non-market tool which is not based on the market price, implemented in the framework of a company's competitive strategy. New industrialization transforms all sectors of the economy. A human is replaced by a robot in many activities. At the same time few studies have discussed the possibility of using a robot for advertising. In fact, it remains unknown how a robot can contribute to advertising contexts. The article aims to determine the ways how companies can use promotion robots and the effect of their use in advertising. The authors apply the case study method based on the secondary data analysis. The paper focuses on promotion robots, manufactured by Promobot, a company located in the Perm Krai of Russia. It is concluded that the use of promotion robots in advertising has several advantages: attracting the visitors' attention, automating the promotion activities, and increasing consumer loyalty.

Developed by SPIE, OSA, and NOAO through funding from the U.S. National Science Foundation, the modules were originally designed for afterschool settings and museums. However, because they were based on national standards in mathematics, science, and technology, they were easily adapted for use in classrooms. The philosophy and implementation strategies of the six modules will be described as well as lessons learned in training educators. The modules were implementing with the help of optics industry professionals who served as expert volunteers to assist educators. A key element of the modules was that they were developed around an understanding of optics misconceptions and used culminating activities in each module as a form of authentic assessment. Thus student achievement could be measured by evaluating the actual product created by each student in applying key concepts, tools, and applications together at the end of each module. The program used a progression of disciplinary core concepts to build an integrated sequence and crosscutting ideas and practices to infuse the principles of the modern electro-optical field into the modules.

Magnetic stirring for 30 min disentangled the fiber networks and the fragmented fibers appeared in the 1 wt% CNF sol. A decrease in the specific viscosity of the diluted sols changed the rheological behavior from exponential to linear below 1 wt%, suggesting a significant decrease in the inter-fibril interaction. The small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) with the generalized indirect Fourier transformation (GIFT) also indicated similar changes in the fiber flocculation structure without a change in the fiber size. The increasing viscosity upon severe fiber fragmentation by a high-pressure homogenizer may be ascribed to tighter holding of the interfibril water molecules. The time-domain (TD)-NMR fully supported the estimation that the transverse relaxation time (T-2) showed consistently short for the 2 wt%, became shorter with the stirring time when diluted from 5 wt% to 2 wt%, and showed long upon dilution from 20 wt% to 2 wt%.

Recent research has called this into question, focusing on the role of confounders of race/ethnicity. However, the role of educator decisions in the dis-proportionality is still unclear. In this study, I examine the role of student race/ethnicity in teachers' categorization of student needs as exceptional and in need of special or gifted education services. I use an original survey experiment in which teachers read case studies of fictional male students in which the race/ethnicity, English Language Learner status, and exceptionality characteristics were experimentally manipulated. The teachers are then asked whether they would refer the student for exceptionality testing. My findings suggest a complex intersection of race/ethnicity and exceptionality, in which white boys are more likely to be suspected of having exceptionalities when they exhibit academic challenges, while boys of color are more likely to be suspected when they exhibit behavioral challenges. This suggests that the racialized construction of exceptionalities reflects differential academic expectations and interpretations of behavior by race/ethnicity, with implications for the subjectivity of exceptionality identification and for the exacerbation of racial/ethnic inequalities in education.

A review of publications in recent years has made it possible to identify benchmarks of educational strategies that can be viable, provided a harmonious combination of a stable value foundation with the flexibility of forms of training and education, to aesthetic perfection. The most important of these landmarks is the identification of the giftedness of children at that age when their psycho-physiological development can significantly enrich the educational process with new subjects, works that are difficult for children to understand and understand. In the fruitful disorder, imitating the structure of the world, as postmodernist thinkers imagine, the child is guided not according to a predetermined plan, but spontaneously, intuitively, structuring reality according to the rules of his talent. Musically gifted children build in a new, obeying to the principles of rhythm, smoothness, fluidity, the system of sounds that he can reproduce, as well as objects available for creativity, movements of his own body, words. The sense of form allows you to create a balanced and aesthetic art composition; their architectonics also indicates giftedness in the field of mathematics, where algorithmic, geometric, and combinatorial abilities determine the success of problem solving. Similar relationships are found between endowments in the field of visual arts and sports, musical and linguistic. The author of the article proposes an approach to the early identification of giftedness by means of modern art, integrating, in the process of understanding life, the accumulated values of culture, the latest scientific discoveries, practical short-term experiment and immediate experience. Students of pedagogical universities, practicing teachers who carry out this approach will have the opportunity to notice, record in diagnostic cards and use in their professional activities the results of monitoring the activities of children, indicating their talent. In addition, by comparing the art product of a child with the creative product of modern authors according to certain criteria, it will be possible to get a certain idea about the similarity of creativity of adults and children, at the level of form, content, and understanding of the same phenomena. Contemporary art, offering a wide range of works, more diverse than ever and created in the process of free copyright.",0,0,Sport Sciences

Here, gecko thrombin (gthrombin) was recombinantly prepared and comparatively studied on its procoagulant activity. MethodsThe 3D structure of gthrombin was constructed using the homology modeling method of I-TASSER. The active gthrombin was prepared by the expression of gecko prethrombin-2 in 293 T cells, followed by purification with Ni2+-chelating column chromatography prior to activation by snake venom-derived Ecarin. The enzymatic activities of gthrombin were assayed by hydrolysis of synthetic substrate S-2238 and the fibrinogen clotting. The vulnerable nerve cells were used to evaluate the toxicity of gthrombin at molecular and cellular levels. ResultsThe active recombinant gthrombin showed super-high catalytic and fibrinogenolytic efficiency than those of human under different temperatures and pH conditions. In addition, gthrombin made nontoxic effects on the central nerve cells including neurons, contrary to those of mammalian counterparts, which contribute to neuronal damage, astrogliosis, and demyelination.

From the woman's perspective, all gifts are not always equally rewarding; the reward value of a gift depends on two factors: (1) the giver and (2) the type of the gift (the gift's social meaning). In this study, we investigated how these two factors interactively determine the reward value of a gift. Specifically, we examined how the neural processing for understanding a gift's social meaning is modulated by preferences for the giver. We performed a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study in which a female participant was asked to judge a gift from a male she was acquainted with in real life. We examined the interactive effects between (1) the female participant's attitude toward the male acquaintance (liked vs. uninteresting) and (2) the type of the gift (romantic [e.g., bouquet, earrings, and perfumes] vs. non-romantic [e.g., pencils, memo pad, and moneybox]). We found that preference for an acquaintance selectively modulated activity in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in response to romantic gifts, compared to non-romantic gifts. In contrast, if the woman was indifferent toward an acquaintance, no activity modulation was observed in this area for the same gifts. In addition, the ACC showed functional connectivity with the supplementary motor area/dorsal ACC (SMA/dACC), an area within the dorsal mediofrontal cortex, suggesting that it integrates action monitoring and emotional and cognitive processing in decision-making. These results suggest that attitude toward an opposite sex member has a modulatory role in recognizing the social meaning of material goods-preference for the member is a powerful modulator of social reward processing.",1,1,Science & Technology - Other Topics

The results show that the male provides a salivary mass as a nuptial gift to the female and starts to copulate with the female in a V-shaped position, then changes to an end-to-end position by temporarily twisting the female abdominal segments VII-IX by 180 degrees. During mating the basal processes and the basal teeth of the gonostyli and the hypandrium are used to obtain copulation and sustain the coupling of genitalia to secure successful sperm transfer.

Workers and corporations scrambled to adjust their workstyles to a new normal, by avoiding the commute and working remotely from their homes or elsewhere. Japan is a country that stood out for its inability to adjust to the remote work environment. Comparative statistics show that Japan reported the lowest number of people engaged in remote work among the OECD countries, as well as the lowest percentage of corporations that offered remote work policies. In this article, I investigate why telework in Japan is difficult. The lack of telework in Japan may seem paradoxical, given the country's reputation for being technologically advanced. I argue that it is not the technological infrastructure that is lacking in the Japanese workplace, but distinct features of work embedded in Japanese culture and its collectivist roots that prevent the effective implementation of telework. I rely on recently published data from various sources, and apply key sociological theories such as implicit contracts, gift exchange, dramaturgy, and impression management to substantiate my main arguments.

Bike gifting and education programs are sometimes delivered to youth to support cycling. This study aimed to assess impacts of a bike education program that involved earning a bike (called Earn-a-Bike) on children's time spent cycling and attitudes and perceptions of cycling. Methods: The Earn-a-Bike program was delivered after school to 38 5th graders living in low-income urban communities, at three different schools. Participants wore global positioning systems (GPS) trackers to provide objective measurements of time spent cycling before and after the program. Participants also completed a pre and post survey and parents completed a post survey on perceptions and attitudes. Statistical models tested changes in time spent cycling and survey responses. Results: Time spent cycling increased from 12.4 to 21.5 min per week (68% increase; F [1, 23.7] = 6.49; p = .018), with similar increases observed between boys and girls and across schools. 59% of trips occurred on the weekends and 27% occurred in the evenings on weekdays, and student survey data corroborated this information. Students reported that the top reasons they participated in the program were to learn about bike safety (66.7%) and to learn how to take care of a bike (66.7%). Parents had positive attitudes/perceptions of the program (85-100% agreement with positive statements). Conclusions: Bike education programs that result in the child earning a bike appear promising for increasing the currently low rates of cycling and active transportation in youth, though multilevel strategies are likely needed to support larger increases in cycling.",1,1,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Transportation"

Professor Wolfe served as the presenter's dissertation advisor from 1979-1982, but occasional industry interactions before and after that 3-year period provided the author a unique before-during-after sampling of this industry leader, author and teacher of Radiometry and applications of infrared technology to optical systems. The collection of selected topics begins with a brief review of the contribution of Max Planck, specifically his discovery of the blackbody radiation law in 1900. The assumption in Planck's equation not only provided the foundation of Quantum Physics, but the venerable equation itself today still serves as convenient basis for self-radiative source characterization in radiation transfer modeling for infrared systems. Subsequent topics of a more personal experience nature will include a successful application example of an advisor's counsel; an insider's life at the early days of Optical Sciences Annex; how history turned on an unlikely OSA scatter paper presentation; social optical engineering observations; the BRDF and development of the first Arizona computer-automated scatterometer; and a Swiss Army knife gift and metaphor.

Most empirical studies and professional guidelines focus on unilateral donor-recipient types of interaction and overlook, or fail to distinguish between, more reciprocal types of interaction. However, the degree of goal alignment and potential for value creation differs in these two types of interactions. Failing to differentiate between these two forms of interaction between pharmaceutical companies and healthcare providers could thus lead to biased conclusions regarding their desirability. This study reviews the empirical literature regarding the effects of bilateral forms of interactions between pharmaceutical companies and healthcare providers in order to explore their effects. Material and methods We searched two medical databases (i.e. PubMed and Cochrane Library) and one business database (i.e. EBSCO) for empirical, peer-reviewed articles concerning any type of bilateral interaction between pharmaceutical companies and healthcare providers. We included quantitative articles which were written in English and published between January 1 st, 2000 and October 31 st, 2016, and where the title or abstract included a combination of synonyms of the following keywords: pharmaceutical companies, healthcare providers, interaction, and effects. Results Our search results yielded 10 studies which were included in our analysis. These studies focused on either research-oriented interaction or on education-oriented interaction. The included studies reported various outcomes of interaction such as prescribing behavior, ethical dilemmas, and research output. Regardless of the type of interaction, the studies either reported no significant effects or ambivalent outcomes such as affected clinical practice or ethical issues. Discussion and conclusion The effects of bilateral interactions reported in the literature are similar to those reported in studies concerning unilateral interactions. The theoretical notion that bilateral interactions between pharmaceutical companies and healthcare providers have different effects given their increased level of goal alignment thus does not seem to hold. However, most of the empirical studies focus on intermediary, provider-level, outcomes such as altered prescribing behavior. Outcomes at the health system level such as overall costs and quality of care are overlooked. Further research is necessary in order to disentangle various forms of value created by different types of interactions between pharmaceutical companies and healthcare providers.",8,8,Science & Technology - Other Topics

Children who choose this option enter the adult world several years earlier than most of their age peers. This involves extra growth, adaptation, and a nontypical route through adolescent developmental milestones. These changes may be a great challenge for children and their families. In this study, we report findings from semi-structured interviews with 36 parents whose children participated in one of two different early entrance to college programs at the University of Washington.

Creating successful affective responses requires considerable effort both to detect student affect and to design appropriate responses to affect. Recent work has suggested that affect detection is more effective when both physical sensors and interaction logs are used, and that context-sensitive design of affective feedback is necessary to enhance engagement and improve learning. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive report on a multi-part study that integrates detection, validation, and intervention into a unified approach. This paper examines the creation of both sensor-based and interaction-based detectors of student affect, producing successful detectors of student affect. In addition, it reports results from an investigation of motivational feedback messages designed to address student frustration, and investigates whether linking these interventions to detectors improves outcomes. Our results are mixed, finding that self-efficacy enhancing interventions based on interaction-based affect detectors enhance outcomes in one of two experiments investigating affective interventions.

Seamus wrote extensively on these and many other themes in the professional and popular literature. In his clinical work, Seamus was a compassionate doctor, effective team-worker and skilled manager. He served as a representative of graduates on the Governing Authority of University College Dublin (2008-2013), secretary (2007-2009) and then president (2009-2014) of the Psychiatry Section of the Royal Academy of Medicine in Ireland, associate editor of the Irish Journal of Medical Science (2012-2019) and a member of the HSE National Shared Record Project. Seamus continuously wrote essays, book reviews, blogs and short stories, and won the 2010 Molly Keane Writing Prize. Philosophy was, perhaps, his greatest intellectual passion and he spoke and wrote extensively on themes linking philosophy with clinical care, the history of psychiatry and reflective practice in medicine. Seamus wrote and co-wrote on a range of other topics including psychiatric liaison with primary care, 'vampirism' as a mental illness, translation and interpretation in psychiatry, synaesthesia, 'new' mental illnesses such as solastalgia and hubris syndrome, bibliotherapy, the work of Nicholas Culpeper (a seventeenth-century English physician) and mental illness among psychiatrists.

We carried out in-depth interviews with 10 homeless crack users assisted by CnaR and 11 health professionals; one Focus Group with 6 users, and Participant Observation of CnaR's work during 2014-2016. Methodology was based on the use of an analytical matrix with theoretical and empirical categories of Territory, Territoriality, Social Support Networks and Gift. Results revealed crack users' territorialities, alternating moments of concentration and disaggregation with high geographical mobility, except in periods of strong consumption of crack. Territorialities are unstable, marked by violent Police repression. In spite of the stories of losses and ruptures, forms of sociability among users and CnaR professionals were identified, as well as with different actors in the territory. All this favoured the formation of supportive networks providing friendship, health care, and other material and symbolic goods. The systematization of the users' informal networks, usually invisible to workers and administrators, is relevant because of its potential to expand the production of care and strengthen the associations in the territory. To understand users' territorialities and the social support networks formed in their everyday life is not only innovative, but also contributes to the formulation of public policies that aim to guarantee civil rights to people in a situation of vulnerability, suffering and social exclusion.",3,3,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Biomedical Social Sciences"

The recently revived neo-Aristotelian virtue ethics tradition finds that MacIntyre's scholarship significantly contributes to virtue ethics in business-particularly his conception of practices, institutions, and internal/external goods. However, we argue that some of his latest insights about the virtues of acknowledged dependence and human vulnerability remain underdeveloped because of the underlying anthropology that neo-Aristotelian virtue ethics relies on. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Polo's transcendental anthropology as a possible foundation of a personalist approach that enriches virtue ethics. To do so, we address how transcendental anthropology can enrich two central aspects of virtue ethics, namely (1) the understanding of human beings and their flourishing and (2) the relationship of virtue to praxis and human work. Finally, to address the practical implications for business leadership and work that can derive from assuming transcendental anthropology, we address how servant leadership acquires a new perspective in light of this personalism and its logic of gift, highlighting interpersonal self-giving as a way of service.",0,0,Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics

However, divergence emerged in terms of the role of school education. While Scottish teachers believed that highly able readers could be developed by school education, Chinese teachers believed that the role of school education was to provide basic education rather than enriched and additional education for highly able students. Chinese teachers regarded family education as the main source to extend highly able children's learning experience.

Findings are based on fifty semi-structured interviews with medical students in the United States and Canada conducted between 2010 and 2013. Participant responses support the survey-based literature demonstrating that there is clear and pervasive influence of the pharmaceutical industry in medical education. They also challenge the theory that medical students feel entitled to industry gifts and un-critically accept industry presence. I investigate how medical students who are critical of the pharmaceutical industry negotiate its presence in the course of their medical education. Findings suggest that these participants do not simply absorb industry presence, but interpret it and respond in complex ways. Participants were uncomfortable with industry influence throughout their medical training and found multifaceted ways to resist. They struggled with power relations in medical training and the prevailing notion that industry presence is a normal part of medical education. I argue that this pervasive norm of industry presence is located in neoliberal structural transformations within and outside both education and medicine. The idea that industry presence is normal and inevitable represents a challenge for students who are critical of industry. Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, some quartets generated always violate these relations, so that they will never suggest any key candidates. Inspired by previous rectangle frameworks, we find that guessing certain key cells before generating quartets may reduce the number of invalid quartets. However, guessing a lot of key cells at once may lose the benefit from the early abort technique, which may lead to a higher overall complexity. To get better tradeoff, we build a new rectangle framework on ciphers with linear key-schedule with the purpose of reducing overall complexity or attacking more rounds. In the tradeoff model, there are many parameters affecting the overall complexity, especially for the choices of the number and positions of key guessing cells before generating quartets. To identify optimal parameters, we build a uniform automatic tool on SKINNY as an example, which includes the optimal rectangle distinguishers for key-recovery phase, the number and positions of key guessing cells before generating quartets, the size of key counters to build that affecting the exhaustive search step, etc. Based on the automatic tool, we identify a 32-round key-recovery attack on SKINNY-128-384 in the related-key setting, which extends the best previous attack by 2 rounds. For other versions with n-2n or n-3n, we also achieve one more round than before.

Compared with the fasting state (0 HAF), plasma glucose increased at 1 HAF, peaked at 3 HAF, decreased at 8 HAF and returned to basal level at 24 HAF. Genes such as glucokinase (gck) and liver type of phosphofructokinase (pfkl) were sensitive indicators for hepatic glycolysis, and their transcription was active at 1-8 HAF, especially at 3 HAF. Genes such as glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit a2(g6pca2) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 2 (pck2) were useful markers for hepatic gluconeogenesis, and their transcription was inhibited at 1-3 HAF, especially at 3 HAF. Hepatic gluconeogenesis was up-regulated with feeding time from 3 to 8 h, suggesting a nutritional status transition from anabolism to catabolism. The mRNA level of glycogen synthase 1 (gys1) increased at 3-8 HAF and liver glycogen accumulated at 8 HAF, but the principal expressed gys2 was unexpectedly down-regulated after feeding, suggesting that glycogen storage might be controlled by Gys1 rather than Gys2 in the liver of tilapia. In line with the increased plasma triglyceride and cholesterol concentrations, the transcription of hepatic lipogenic genes including acetyl-CoA carboxylase a (acca), ATP citrate lyase a (aclya) and fatty acid synthase (fas) were all up-regulated during 1-8 HAF (especially 3-8 HAF), suggesting that hepatic lipogenesis was an efficient way to dispose excess glucose in tilapia. Hepatic glucose transport was induced since the feeding time was over 8 h, indicating that hepatic glucose production was already transported to extra-hepatic tissues at 8 HAF, which further confirmed the nutritional status transition at this time. Taking the results together, it was suggested that the physiologically specific time point of postprandial nutritional status transition from anabolism to catabolism occurred at about or a little earlier than 8 HAF in tilapia.

This allows them to secure matings, while saving on the energetic costs of gift production. Biases in adult sex ratios can alter the intensity of sexual selection by enhancing competition for mates. Under intense competition males increase their investment in behaviors to outcompete rivals (e.g., fighting). Yet, given that in male-biased environments mating opportunities are rare males may alternatively reduce costly courtship and/or adopt alternative reproductive tactics (ARTs). Males of the spider Pisaura mirabilis adopt different mating tactics, offering females genuine nuptial gifts (prey), nutritionally worthless gifts (prey leftovers), or no gifts. To test whether behavioral shifts between gift tactics are triggered by changes in the competitive environment, we established replicate spider populations under natural conditions at varying adult sex ratios (male-biased, female-biased and equal) and sampled gift tactics repeatedly over time. We additionally explored how male individual traits, such as body size and condition, affect the expression of ARTs. In male-biased populations males produced more gifts but of low quality, suggesting competition to trigger increased mating effort to ensure mate acquisition and fertilizations, but through a worthless gift tactic. Production of gifts and of genuine gifts was favored by high body condition, pointing to energetic limitations as being central for male reproductive capacity. We hence highlight two co-existing mechanisms at play to explain ARTs in this system, the competitive social environment where expression of gift tactics is based on optimal-decision making to overcome competition, and a conditional strategy linked to the individual's energetic state.",1,1,Behavioral Sciences; Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Zoology

However, silkworm pupae are prone to oxidative rancidity due to the high content of unsaturated fatty acids, which limits its large-scale use in feed. A 56-day feeding study was conducted to determine the effects of oxidized silkworm pupae on growth performance, structure and function of the intestine, liver and muscle in genetically improved farmed tilapia (GIFT, Oreochromis niloticus). Three approximately isonitrogenous (crude protein: 328 g kg(-1)) and isolipidic (crude lipid: 56 g kg(-1)) diets were formulated containing 4% fresh silkworm pupae, lightly oxidized silkworm pupae and highly oxidized silkworm pupae, which named FSP, LOSP and HOSP respectively. Three groups of GIFT with an initial weight of (44.22 +/- 0.54) g were randomly assigned to each diet. The results showed that the weight gain rate (WGR), specific growth rate and feed intake decreased with increasing silkworm pupae oxidative levels (p < 0.05). Villus height in LOSP and HOSP significantly decreased with increasing silkworm pupae oxidative levels (p < 0.05), while villus number and muscular thickness of foregut were similar among three groups (p > 0.05). Dietary oxidized silkworm pupae significantly reduced the activity of intestinal Na+-K+-ATPase compared with FSP group (p < 0.05), whereas that was similar in LOSP and HOSP groups (p > 0.05). The activities of intestinal protease, lipase and pepsin in HOSP group were significantly reduced compared with FSP group (p < 0.05), whereas those were similar in LOSP and FSP groups (p > 0.05). Hepatocytes with swelling and nuclear migration occurred in the liver of LOSP and HOSP groups. Malondialdehyde (MDA) content of LOSP and HOSP groups in liver was significantly higher than that in FSP group (p < 0.05). Muscular histological examinations indicated that muscle fibre atrophy occurred in HOSP group. The content of crude protein and crude ash in muscle of HOSP group was significantly reduced compared with FSP and LOSP groups (p < 0.05). n-ary sumation n-3PUFA contents in the muscle of HOSP decreased by 37.28% compared with FSP group (p < 0.05). To sum up, dietary oxidized silkworm pupae inhibited growth, reduced the gastrointestinal digestive and absorptive capacity and hepatic antioxidant capacity, and the negative impacts were increased with the increasing oxidative degree of silkworm pupae. In addition, highly oxidized silkworm pupae have a destructive effect on the histological structure of the foregut, liver and muscle.",4,5,Fisheries

These individual differences in ability level and in pattern of specific abilities, which are uncovered by the use of above-level assessments, structure consequential quantitative and qualitative differences in educational, occupational, and creative outcomes. There is no threshold effect for abilities in predicting future accomplishments; and the concept of multipotentiality evaporates when assessments cover the full range of all three primary abilities. Beyond abilities, educational/occupational interests add value in identifying optimal learning environments for precocious youth and, with the addition of conative variables, for modeling subsequent life span development. While overall professional outcomes of exceptionally precocious youth are as exceptional as their abilities, educational interventions of sufficient dosage enhance the probability of them leading exceptionally impactful careers and making creative contributions.

Prior correlational research found that this genius stereotype is negatively related to students' pSTEM motivation. However, the effect has not been explored experimentally to evaluate possible casual influences. Using situated expectancy-value theory as a framework, the present experiment tested whether media invoking the genius stereotype negatively impacts high school students' expectancy and value beliefs regarding pSTEM. Methods: The sample comprised of 213 U.S. high school students (53% boys, 46% Asian). Participants read one of two versions of an article profiling a student majoring in computer science. The genius condition emphasized the student's natural talent and the importance of being gifted for success in computer science, whereas the control condition did not mention these attributes. Pre- and post-test measures of pSTEM expectancy and value beliefs were assessed. Results and Conclusions: Students in the genius condition, but not the control condition, demonstrated a significant decline in pSTEM value beliefs. There was no effect on expectancy beliefs. Thus, popular stereotypes of persons in pSTEM as geniuses may contribute to students devaluing of pSTEM subjects. These stereotypes may be especially threatening to girls and students from minoritized backgrounds. Implications are discussed, including the need to address genius stereotypes in pSTEM classrooms.",0,0,Psychology

New ways of introducing medical students to anatomy (including living anatomies and virtual simulations) have provoked widespread debate, with discussion of their relative merits compared to more traditional approaches that use cadaveric dissection. Outside the field of medicine, in the wider public sphere, the practice of anatomical study may often seem mysterious. The dissemination of news on anatomy, we contend, is central to the question of how medical researchers and educators engage with the public. Our analysis of news media coverage in the UK demonstrates that news-making, by giving prominence to certain facts, themes and images, serves to mask issues about anatomy and its practices that need debate. We examine the ways in which news media, through processes of selection and the 'framing' of issues, may perform an agenda-setting role. We draw attention to the use of positive 'awe and amazement' frames including 'miracles of modern science', 'medical heroes', and 'gifts of life', alongside more negative 'guts and gore' coverage including 'Frankenstein', 'Brave New World' and 'Rape of the Body' frames that concentrate on high profile scandals associated with the use and misuse of human bodies, tissues and parts. We also highlight the selective use of commentaries from members of the medical profession, which are more prevalent in positive,awe and amazement' stories than in stories with negative coverage. We conclude by arguing for greater collaboration between journalists on the one hand, and medical educators and researchers on the other, in the making of news in order to provide portrayals of anatomy which bear a closer relationship to the everyday reality of professional work.

By showing the interconnections among molecular, microscopic, and macroscopic treatments of these three transport processes, as well as the underlying similarities among the three transport processes, he has enabled chemical engineers to contribute to many new areas. In his research he has focused on polymeric fluids - their rheology and fluid mechanics - again spanning molecular to macroscopic problems. Bird is also known throughout the profession as a superb teacher and lecturer. He is gifted in languages and music, and he has a great love of the outdoors.

Through the extensive use of archival and narrative sources, it demonstrates that girls in pre-Tanzimat Istanbul enjoyed ample opportunities for elementary education. Two registers of the distribution of imperial gifts to schools in Istanbul, one in the 1780s and the other in 1811, reveal the existence of a substantial number of girls' schools run by female teachers. Many of these schools presumably operated in teachers' private homes, but there were also vakif-funded girls' schools. Additionally, girls benefited from coeducational schools. Drawing on these findings, I estimate that, in 1811, approximately one-fifth of the girls living in Istanbul received elementary schooling, and that there were about 100 female teachers in Istanbul. The increasing visibility of girls' schools and female teachers can be considered in the context of social change in the eighteenth century.",1,1,Arts & Humanities - Other Topics

To date, however, it is unclear how varying intellectual profiles relate to differential aspects of child functioning. We screened 513 fifth-grade children on their intellectual abilities and selected three groups of gifted children, scoring in the top 10%: analytically gifted (n = 14), creatively gifted (n = 18), and analytically creatively gifted (n = 13). Of the remaining typically developing children, a group of 152 children was selected. We examined how these groups differed in cognitive, socio-emotional, and academic aspects of child functioning. A comparison of the gifted group as a whole versus the typically developing group, showed higher scores for the gifted group on cognitive functioning, self-concept, and academic functioning. Fine-grained group comparisons showed especially the analytical-creative subgroup to score higher than the typically developing group on visual and verbal short term memory (STM), motivation, and self-concept. Furthermore, both creatively gifted subgroups outperformed the typically developing group regarding vocabulary, while all three gifted subgroups outperformed the typically developing group regarding arithmetic. A combination of high analytical and creative abilities, which was found in 2.5% of the sample, thus seemed to lead to enhanced functioning in all three domains (i.e. cognitive, socio-emotional, and academic).",6,6,Education & Educational Research; Psychology

The purpose of our survey of practicing physicians in Japan was to assess the extent of their involvement in pharmaceutical promotional activities, physician characteristics that predict such involvement, attitudes toward relationships with PRs, correlations between the extent of involvement and attitudes, and differences in the extent of involvement according to self-reported prescribing behaviors. Methods and Findings: From January to March 2008, we conducted a national survey of 2621 practicing physicians in seven specialties: internal medicine, general surgery, orthopedic surgery, pediatrics, obstetrics-gynecology, psychiatry, and ophthalmology. The response rate was 54%. Most physicians met with PRs (98%), received drug samples (85%) and stationery (96%), and participated in industry-sponsored continuing medical education (CME) events at the workplace (80%) and outside the workplace (93%). Half accepted meals outside the workplace (49%) and financial subsidies to attend CME events (49%). Rules at the workplace banning both meetings with PRs and gifts predicted less involvement of physicians in promotional activities. Physicians valued information from PRs. They believed that they were unlikely to be influenced by promotional activities, but that their colleagues were more susceptible to such influence than themselves. They were divided about the appropriateness of low-value gifts. The extent of physician involvement in promotional activities was positively correlated with the attitudes that PRs are a valuable source of information and that gifts are appropriate. The extent of such involvement was higher among physicians who prefer to ask PRs for information when a new medication becomes available, physicians who are not satisfied with patient encounters ending only with advice, and physicians who prefer to prescribe brand-name medications. Conclusions: Involvement in pharmaceutical promotional activities is widespread among practicing physicians in Japan. The extent of such involvement varies according to certain physician characteristics. As a group, they are at risk for influence by promotional activities.",49,52,Science & Technology - Other Topics

In this regard, in recent years, acute problems have been raised unfairly overlooked by educators from Kazakhstan. In particular, this can be attributed to the insufficient knowledge of the experience of religious pedagogy, which is very useful and interesting in terms of approaches to teaching and educating the individual. For example: in the textbooks and educational programs on pedagogy and the history of pedagogy in Kazakhstan, for the time being there is no proper place to mention the history of the pedagogical thought of Muslim peoples, who have a rich experience of religious education [Seitaliev, 2007]. Methods: Analysis of the works of sociologists, teachers on the problems of Muslim pedagogy, the role of activity in the development of religious education. Study and analysis of scientific literature, materials and documents. Findings: In this regard, we can talk about the urgent need to conduct a systematic historical and pedagogical analysis of the development of religious education of the Islamic world. Professor Altay Taizhanov, considering Islam in the context of education, rightly notes his enormous educational potential, and that in Islam an important place is given to science and education. In particular: Only in the Quran more than 700 times there are stories that emphasize the special role of education and science in the life of society [Taizhanov, 2009]. Improvements: Therefore, education and science have always played a huge role in the development of Islamic states. Especially in the early period of its development, Islam as the state religion of the medieval states of the Muslim East became the main determinant of the rapid development of education and science, thereby transforming the intellectual potential into a determining factor for the advance development of Islamic civilization.",0,0,Education & Educational Research

Our preceding pilot data identified six high-yield topics for this setting. The study objective was to evaluate screencast educational efficacy. Methods Internal medicine residents scheduled to start a rotation on the primary HOS of an academic medical center were eligible for this parallel, unblinded, randomized controlled trial with concealed allocation. Participants underwent block randomization to the usual educational curriculum either with or without access to a series of novel screencasts; all participants received an anonymous online end-of-rotation survey and a $20 gift certificate upon completion. The primary outcome was the change in attitude among learners, measured as their self-reported confidence for managing the clinical topics. Results From 12/9/2019 through 6/15/2020, accrual was completed with 67 of 78 eligible residents (86%) enrolled and randomized. Analysis was by intention-to-treat and participant response rate was 91%. Sixty-four percent of residents in the treatment arm rated their clinical management comfort level as comfortable or very comfortable versus 21% of residents in the usual education arm (p = 0.001), estimated difference = 43% (95% CI: 21-66%), using a prespecified cumulative cutoff score. Treatment arm participants reported that the screencasts improved medical oncology knowledge base (100%), would improve their care for cancer patients (92%), and had an enjoyable format (96%).

To investigate the effect of sperm digestion on the sex allocation of simultaneous hermaphrodites, we constructed models about evolutionarily stable resource allocation between male and female functions. We assumed that resource obtained from sperm digestion is used for gametogenesis (sperm and/or egg production). As a result, we found that sperm digestion increases the evolutionarily stable allocation to male function under finite number of matings. This is because excess sperm function as nuptial gift or paternal investment when at least a fraction of digested sperm is translated into eggs. Therefore, some factors which affect the assurance of paternity for sperm donors, such as cryptic female choice and/or sperm displacement, may change the result.

A personal, reflective, account linking higher education & community development",JOURNAL OF PEDAGOGIC DEVELOPMENT,,LIFE PATHS,"Higher education is in a state of flux. With austerity challenging assumptions of a comfortable career path for academics. Many academics report pressure to perform across research and teaching. In this article the author addresses two questions why do people become academics? And how, if at all, are university teaching, and community development connected? The research explored includes personal reflection; views on academic teaching from colleagues, plus those from academics at a number of UK universities. Amongst the findings is the fact that a number of responding UK academics expressed the view that they had stepped onto a 'conveyor belt' that led from positive undergraduate experience, eventually to an academic post. The findings also present a strong case for alignment and mutual reinforcement of higher education teaching and approaches to community engagement. The one nurtures the other. In this article my aim is to understand why academics in the 21st century choose their profession. During the 1970s I was lucky enough to be taught by the late-Professor Gerald Wibberley at London University. 'Wibb', as he was affectionately known, was an inspiring practical academic, who seemed to enjoy teaching and research. If he were alive today, we would say he was steeped in understanding and acting to promote sustainability. In this he was years ahead of his time; and like the best academics he didn't dodge difficult questions, and argued using evidence. Professor Wibberley had been strongly involved in developing UK agricultural policy for Government, but underwent a 'conversion'; in that he became vocal about the ills of technologically-driven farming - destruction of wildlife, decimation of jobs on the land and pollution. To illustrate his academic fearlessness, I remember, as an undergraduate, being captivated by his account of a run-in with the National Farmers' Union. At their annual conference he warned, 'if you don't behave, and mend your damaging practices, well.... think yourself lucky we live in a democracy because - if we became a dictatorship - they could take you outside, put you against a wall and shoot the lot of you'! He concluded with relish that as a result the audience had lined up to lynch him! His obituary in the Independent newspaper (Clayton, 1993) read: 'His gift for public speaking was memorable. But he was at his most eloquent when gently berating a hostile audience for not seeing the folly of their views.'",2,2,Education & Educational Research

However, how students construct their identities within STEM is important for maintaining their engagement within STEM fields over time. If we condition students to expect positive feedback for having an aptitude in a STEM field early-on, what I deem genius culture, we risk helping these students develop resilience when faced with challenges. Although, if we tell students that everyone can succeed in STEM, we risk deflating students who are gifted or talented in STEM and equating growth/improvement as mastery, thereby discouraging inquiry. Moreover, as instructors, our own sense of STEM-self affects how we teach and reward our students for their successes. A more sustainable goal is to make students aware of their STEM-self and help students bolster their sense of belonging in STEM rather than acknowledging only their perceived successes or failures.",0,0,Education & Educational Research

Previous studies have suggested that the behavior of males who lost in male-male competition (loser male) differs between two geographically separated populations. In the Aichi population, loser males wait around the feeding area and attempt forced mating with females as satellites (Thornhill, Anim Behav 44:867-879, 1992a), while in the Okayama population, loser males frequently try to re-enter the feeding area as sneakers, and the loser males who succeed in sneaking attempt to mate with present females (Ishihara and Miyatake, J Ethol 39:267-274, 2021). However, these two studies were conducted about 30 years apart, and many factors may have changed since that time. Therefore, in the present study, mating behaviors of the two populations were compared within the same year by field observations. Our results showed that most of the individuals in the Okayama population stayed near their feeding grounds longer on average than the Aichi population while repeatedly snaking. On the other hand, in the Aichi population, more individuals left the feeding area than those who chose sneaking. In addition, the number of females visiting the feeding area was significantly higher in the Okayama population. Results of a laboratory experiment using males from two local populations showed that the behavior of loser males was similar to field observations. These findings suggest that males from the two populations adopt alternative mating tactics. We discuss the reasons why the populations show different mating tactics.",0,0,Behavioral Sciences; Zoology

Unlike most stop-the-clock extensions, which occur on an individual basis, the stop-the-tenure-clock during COVID-19 was a mass-triggering event that applied to all faculty. Informed by social role theory, we examined this unique situation of stop-the-tenure clock decisions by faculty at two different universities within the same state system. Institutional level demographic and field of study data on faculty decision making at one high research activity university (n = 97) and one very high research activity university (n = 387) were examined at two time points; a first tenure-clock stop opportunity and a second tenure-clock stop opportunity. Results show that although the overall rates of clock-stops were much larger at the research-intense university, the characteristics of who was most likely to accept or opt out of the first tenure-clock stop were similar at both universities. Ethnic minoritized faculty at both universities had greater odds of accepting the clock-stop. Results also showed that at both universities, women were somewhat more likely to accept the first tenure clock extension, and exploratory follow-up shows this gendered decision manifested differently depending on field of study. Relatively few faculty accepted the second tenure clock-stop.

Bringing emerging technologies into the school encourages the students to cultivate skills and attitudes that will empower them to ride the present and future waves of information and technology most meaningfully and innovatively. Photonics has diverse applications in the modem technological world, and Singapore aims to become a centre of excellence for optics and photonics in the region. However, a serious study of photonics, begins only at the college level (K - 11/12). Entrusted with Singapore's brightest young minds, RI pioneered the development of a Photonics Exploratory Laboratory (X-LAB), being the first among secondary (K-7 to K-10) schools in Singapore and possibly in the region. Young RI students are learning photonics fundamentals and recognizing photonics as a potentially rewarding field of study. With the expertise of lecturers from tertiary institutions, selected RI students are instructed in basic theory and trained in fundamental experiments. These students progress to embark on projects and in-depth studies under the wing of tertiary institutions and universities. Studies on Haidinger Fringes, Laser Doppler Anemometry and Optical Gratings have thus been successfully completed. Furthermore, the X-LAB acts as a focal point for students to experiment with Holography and Laser Animation.",1,1,Education & Educational Research; Optics

The sanctions have caused hyperinflation, economic contraction, and devaluation of the currency. In response, the residents of Iran have developed a variety of coping strategies to ease the miseries of life. This article draws on fieldwork undertaken in Jiroft, a city in southeast Iran, between January and July 2019 to explore how, as Iranian banks struggle under economic sanctions, an old association of financial mutuality called Bazl has been revived in the area. In the reinvented Bazl system, people, frustrated with the banks, form Bazl groups to transfer their cash to each other as gifts with the expectation of reciprocation in the future. The amount of cash circulated through the Bazl system is estimated at 1,500 billion Iranian rials (US$140 million) annually. Under the current circumstance, choosing Bazl over banks as a means of storing value for the future appears to be a rational choice.",0,0,Anthropology

The aim of this study is to evaluate and compare the published donation forms used by body donation programs in the United States and assess them according to the guidelines published by the American Association of Clinical Anatomists. The findings of this study shows that the level of information given to donors and families, before consenting to whole body donation, varies greatly throughout the United States. Many of the forms fail to include the recommendations made by professional societies. Additional information needs to be added to whole body donation forms to better inform donors and families about the donation process, what happens to the body, and the final disposition of the bodies once studies are completed.

Results and discussion Nearly 50% (8/17) of the children showed learning disabilities, when corrected for IQ in the academic evaluations. Isolated impaired literacy skills, particularly spelling problems, were most frequent (4/8), whereas a pure arithmetic learning disability was rare (1/8). Three children presented both learning disabilities. Results on academic and neuropsychological tests did not fit the well-known types of learning disabilities - nonverbal learning disability (NLD) and dyslexia. Nearly all NF1 children showed visual perceptual and executive dysfunctions. In this study, teachers more frequently reported behavioural problems in NF1 children than parents, as opposed to literature data in a general population. The correspondence of the perception of internalizing problems between the children and teachers was greater than between children and their parents. No correlation was found between the performances on the WISC-R, specific neuropsychological results, academic performances and behavioural problems.

Here, we report that the massive numbers of the terrestrial earthworms were supplied intensively to an upstream of the small river in early winter. In particular, we found large numbers of megascolecid earthworms were supplied in an upstream of the small river in Northern Japan. Furthermore, we observed that supplied earthworms were consumed by salmonid fish species (masu salmon, white spotted char and rainbow trout) and aquatic invertebrates (gammarid amphipod, planarian flatworm, and stonefly larvae).

The campus staff specializes both in teaching structured courses in different fields, and in conducting hands-on competitive and multidisciplinary network events, in which thousands of young people participate each year. The wide-ranging activities are multilingual and are based on simple technological means that are accessible to youngsters and provoke their curiosity such as the Internet, messaging software and cell phones. Learning takes place by means of unique modules providing an enriching, active, challenging and fascinating intellectual experience. We offer exclusive programs, with added value resulting from the encounter between the students and lecturers and researchers from the academic faculty and the rich and diverse world of content that the University offers. This is a virtual learning model that comprises a number of practical tasks for which the students receive instructions: experimentation, programming, simulation, role-playing or riddle solving. It requires making use of theoretical material appearing on the website or available on the Internet. In the course of the tasks the instructor gives the students online advice and guidance, and after each task there is a chat session. The courses allow a different kind of learning, covering a wide range of subjects. An ongoing course demands an additional dimension of commitment and seriousness on the part of the students. The more active the students, the more benefit they reap from the e-learning program. To succeed in the course, students have to put in independent work and virtual attendance at all the meetings. Students have to be active in forums and discussion groups, to learn the theoretical content, and to submit assignments. At the end of the course, a grade and a certificate of participation is issued. We offer a wide range of course topics, including astronomy, medicine, psychology, physics, sociology, chemistry, biology, anthropology, archaeology and others. They are presented as a single topic course or as a multidisciplinary course. We also offer an innovative study model which includes a physical encounter between participants. Proceeding is a virtual thriller: a joint virtual adventure. They deal with a variety of tasks in different subjects, search websites, and use Internet simulations. Gradually the course website publishes investigation updates and reveals new pieces of information. Occasionally the participants receive online expert advice, and interview the characters of the virtual plot. The Virtual Campus of the Unit for Science Oriented Youth holds culminating virtual events and competition days for groups of students from all around the world. The meetings are challenging serve as a peak activity for youngsters who have been involved in enrichment activities throughout the school year.

The most prominent barrier to truly synthesizing and reconciling architectural design studio education methods with energy consumption literacy and calculation has been the complexity of software and often associated technical knowledge requirements. While the singularly gifted student may be able to navigate complex modeling software and complete architectural design studies concurrently, we observe that it is more often the case that modeling typically drives students toward two divergent outcomes. On the one hand, students find the modeling so compelling that their architectural design outcomes fail to be particularly culturally compelling or beautiful but are simulated to perform well. On the other hand, students become frustrated with the modeling parameters and limitations and ignore the modeling system in favor of design expression. Some pedagogical breakthroughs have been realized in our experience by using schematic design level energy simulation software in architecture design education. This paper develops a compelling thesis for architecture design education pedagogy that fuses the competing design agenda of expression and simulated energy consumption modeling, supported by examples of student work.

These schools, found in the US, parts of Southeast Asia, and Australia, are typically not held accountable through standardized testing but through other less well-defined measures. Here, we examine a specialized US STEM school to show why it is important for such a school to demonstrate accountability through everyday school operations - the projection of positive school image, the control of teacher quality, and the provision of advanced classroom curriculum. Using Foucault's concept of power as a microanalytic tool to critically examine artifacts and critical narratives constructed from interviews and lesson observations, we show how institutional, professional, and personal accountabilities were achieved using hierarchical observations, normalizing views, examination, and simple tools. The broad implication for education policy makers is that accountability measures extend beyond standardized test scores, and to adequately understand how they function within schools, we need to consider other types of evidence arising from school-identified goals and aims.",5,5,Education & Educational Research

Many students find programming to be a dry and tedious task doable only by students gifted with strong analytical skills. Teaching introductory programming via creative writing begins by connecting the planning, organizing, and detailing of writing a story to the programming process. Creative concepts are taught first and then connected to an equivalent programming concept. Group-oriented activities using art, Mad-Libs (TM), Potato Heads (TM), and Legos (TM) allow students to actively make the connections among the creative concepts, analytical concepts, and programming skills. Students work in pairs. Student pairings are assigned by matching a student with analytical tendencies with a student majoring in one of the humanities disciplines. The pairs apply the concepts and skills by creating stories, designing an animation, and implementing the animation using the Alice programming system. This research recognizes the creative nature of programming, invites students who would not consider studying programming to potentially identify an unrecognized talent, and attempts to develop a new approach for teaching introductory programming. This research and teaching is sponsored by a NSF Grant [11].",8,8,Computer Science; Education & Educational Research

For this, we observed fifth and sixth graders' drawing processes in a gifted science class involving learning physics concepts in mechanics. The analysis was carried out on three pictorial representational levels: sensory (e.g. observed materials), unseen substance (e.g. molecules) and unseen non-substance (e.g. forces). We found that there were five patterns of interplay depending on the sequential path through the pictorial representational levels. All students began drawing explanatory diagrams from the sensory level as the first step and then constructed explanations using the unseen levels based on the interplay among different levels. In the process of forming meaningful relationships among the three levels of representation, students focused on a specific phenomenon through drawing at a sensory level and extended their making sense of the phenomenon from what happened to why it happened. Based on these findings, we suggest how teachers can use the interplay among the different pictorial representational levels to guide students in generating scientific explanations through drawing.",10,10,Education & Educational Research

We performed this study to assess responses to common challenges to medical professionalism and to ascertain physician satisfaction with training in professionalism. METHODS: A self-administered questionnaire containing six challenges to professionalism (acceptance of gifts, conflict of interest, confidentiality, physician impairment, sexual harassment, and honesty) with multiple-choice responses was mailed to 528 medical students and 779 house officers at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center and to 900 randomly selected Colorado physicians. Information about previous exposure to the issue depicted in the scenarios and satisfaction with, and site of, previous education in medical professionalism was obtained. An independent panel selected the best or acceptable answers to the challenges. RESULTS: In all, 961 evaluable responses were received. More than 40% of physicians reported experience with four of the six challenges. The frequency of the best or acceptable answers to the six scenarios ranged from 12% to 86%. Best or acceptable responses were more common in physicians than in house officers, and in house officers than in medical students (P <0.001). practice setting and specialty type had only modest effects. The physician impairment scenario was the most challenging: Only 12% of physicians provided the best answer. Most (73%) respondents reported having 10 or fewer hours of formal course work in professionalism, and many (40%) were dissatisfied with their training in professionalism. CONCLUSIONS: While everyday challenges to professionalism are commonly encountered by trainees and practicing physicians, many practitioners are dissatisfied with their training in this area and were unable to provide an acceptable answer to these challenges.

The study analyzes the organizational and representational practices of this voluntary desegregation tool-a partial-site magnet program for gifted students-and its impact on students inside and outside the program. in doing so, the study reveals how, in contrast to its stated mission, this form of voluntary desegregation actually constitutes a form of resegregation. Based on ethnographic fieldwork, this research reveals a series of practices that have produced exclusionary access to the gifted program, limited the interaction between magnet and non-magnet students, and instituted an apparently color-blind discourse of the gifted as in need of protection, all contributing to a widespread though complex and contradictory notion of whiteness as giftedness. Such notions run counter to the original intent of the desegregation ruling in Brown v. Board of Education. Revealing the processes by which a desegregation instrument facilitates such contradictory outcomes provides critical insights into the dynamic nature of racial formation.",49,49,Sociology

Studying and improving young students' awareness may increase organ donation rates. This study aimed to investigate young students' knowledge, attitude and information regarding organ donation and whether they are modified by putative predictors. Material/Methods: A 62-item electronic questionnaire was sent to 1451 eligible students aged 18-30 years in 16 Greek public technical schools. Two composite scales (knowledge and attitude) were created. The multivariate statistical analysis included ordinal logistic and linear regression, as appropriate. Results: Only 37.9% of the students knew the correct definition of organ donation, 40.3% knew which organs can be donated, 27.4% were informed about the new Greek legislation, and 83.1% acknowledged the need for better information. Although 60.5% would donate an organ after death, only 16.1% would become living donors. Although 83.1% of the students declared knowing what brain death means, 18.6% believe that a brain-dead person could fully recover and 32.3% are unsure about it. Being a health professional or a blood donor, the parent's educational level, the wish to donate all organs after death, the information from announcements or posters, the fear of organ removal after death without prior consent, the consent for autopsy, the wish for better information, and the misbelief that a brain-dead person could fully recover emerged as important predictors of the knowledge and attitude, regarding organ donation. Conclusions: An important lack of knowledge and misperceptions were noted regarding organ donation. Significant predictors were identified.",10,10,Surgery; Transplantation

Thus, commercial interests are not eligible to be accredited organizations offering continuing medical education (CME) credit to physicians. This decision is based on the concern that commercial interests may use CME events to market their products or services to physicians, who then might inappropriately prescribe or administer those products or services to patients. Studies have shown that CME events supported by pharmaceutical companies, for example, have influenced physicians' prescribing behaviors. Currently, however, the ACCME does not recognize electronic health record (EHR) vendors, which are part of a multi-billion-dollar business, as commercial interests, and it accredits them to provide or directly influence CME events. Like pharmaceutical company-sponsored CME events, EHR vendor activities, which inherently only focus on use of the sponsoring vendor's EHR system despite its potential intrinsic limitations, can lead to physician reciprocity. Such events also may inappropriately influence EHR system purchases, upgrades, and implementation decisions. These actions can negatively influence patient safety and care. Thus, the authors of this Perspective call on the ACCME to recognize EHR vendors as commercial interests and remove them from the list of accredited CME providers.",1,1,Education & Educational Research; Health Care Sciences & Services

A systematic review,BMJ OPEN,education & training (see medical education & training); medical education & training; human resource management,ATTRIBUTES; OPINIONS,"Objectives In order to recognise and facilitate the development of excellent medical doctors (physicians and residents), it is important to first identify the characteristics of excellence. Failure to recognising excellence causes loss of talent, loss of role models and it lowers work ethos. This causes less than excellent patient care and lack of commitment to improve the healthcare system. Design Systematic review performed according to the Association for Medical Education in Europe guideline. Information sources We searched Medline, Embase, Psycinfo, ERIC and CINAHL until 14 March 2022. Eligibility criteria We included original studies describing characteristics of excellent medical doctors, using a broad approach as to what is considered excellence. Assuming that excellence will be viewed differently depending on the interplay, and that different perspectives (peers, supervisors and patients) will add to a complete picture of the excellent medical doctor, we did not limit this review to a specific perspective. Data extraction and synthesis Data extraction and quality assessment were performed independently by two researchers. We used the Quality Assessment Tool for Different Designs for quality assessment. Results Eleven articles were eligible and described the characteristics from different perspectives: (1) physicians on physicians, (2) physicians on residents, (3) patients on physicians and (4) mixed group (diverse sample of participants on physicians). The included studies showed a wide range of characteristics, which could be grouped into competencies (communication, professionalism and knowledge), motivation (directed to learning and to patient care) and personality (flexibility, empathy). Conclusions In order to define excellence of medical doctors three clusters seem important: competence, motivation and personality. This is in line with Renzulli's model of gifted behaviour. Our work adds to this model by specifying the content of these clusters, and as such provides a basis for definition and recognition of medical excellence.",0,0,General & Internal Medicine

The recent public dissection of a body donor is a regression to an unethical historical practice and was strongly denounced by anatomists around the world. The individual whose donated body was sourced from a 'for-profit  company in the United States had not given consent for a public dissection. This violates the ethics surrounding consent and body donation and potentially places the future of body donor programs in jeopardy as it compromises community frameworks around epistemic trust. Recent guiding frameworks by international anatomical associations on the ethical use of bodies have cemented the way in which body donor programs should operate. This viewpoint reflects on past and current events pertaining to public dissections and questions how these indignities may influence the public's interaction with human bodies. The authors argue that public dissection should be prohibited as it is against social mores. Social pressure should be applied to individuals or companies who wish to profit from unethical anatomical practice and legislation prohibiting public dissection should be introduced in those countries where it does not yet exist.",0,0,Education & Educational Research

We were interested in finding the ways hypermedia technology could be used as cognitive tools to share the responsibilities of teachers to provide necessary scaffolding to support students' learning in a problem-based learning (PBL) environment. Of particular interest to this study was to understand if non-gifted students could succeed in a PBL environment where scaffolding was provided through technology in addition to that from a teacher. Since this environment was multimedia rich and game like, we also wanted to find out if girls would perform as well as boys. Both quantitative and qualitative data were used. The findings have shown that the enriched presentation of the knowledge base and the more effective delivery of cognitive tools through hypermedia, technology have provided needed scaffolding to all students in the 6th grade classrooms. As a result, not only students in gifted education but also students in regular education performed well in this technology enhanced PBL environment. In addition, students, who speak English as a second language or have some learning disability, also benefited from using it. The amount of gain in students' science knowledge and problem-solving skills was related to their prior knowledge level. This study has also indicated that due to a large amount of reading involved, slow readers found this PBL environment challenging. More support, via technology or teachers, is needed for these students. To our encouragement, and contrary to the recent computer attitude and gender research, no gender difference was found in the performance, nor in the attitudes among the students in this study. Girls performed equally well and had positive attitudes toward the PBL environment and learning science as a result of using it. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",37,38,Psychology

Although the legal/ethical aspects of promotional activities have been discussed in a limited manner, the patient has remained the neglected variable of this equation. The goal of our study, therefore, is to investigate the patients' opinion on the promotional activities of pharmaceutical companies. Method A descriptive study was conducted at 44 primary health care centers in Turkey and 584 volunteers who applied to these centers were included. A questionnaire consisting of 42 questions was developed with demographic information in the first section, and drug ads and promotions included in the second section. Chi-square test and logistic regression analysis were used for statistical analysis. Main outcome mesaures The awareness and ethical evaluation of patients of the promotional activities. Results Nearly 83% of the participants were aware of the promotion issue. Eighty percent found it unethical, 82% suggested that promotional activities should be forbidden, restricted or regulated. 1/3 of the participants believed that physicians made their drug choices based on the gifts and ads of pharmaceutical companies. Half of them had low confidence in the prescriptions of physicians who accepted gifts from the pharmaceutical companies. 54.5% of patients also considered promotional activities as a factor which increased drug prices. Conclusions In our study, a considerable number of patients were aware of promotions and the effects of promotion on prescriptions. The findings of our study may contribute to the development of effective regulations on this issue. Very strict measures controlling drug companies' promotion activities must be formulated. Further, these regulations must incorporate and take into consideration the patients' opinion.

Following the General Medical Council recommendations for curricular change and the development of more community-based reaching, 'ordinary patients' in the community are increasingly being partnered with undergraduate students for particular projects. Very little research has been undertaken on patients' perceptions of this role. Design Semi-structured interviews were carried our with 20 people to explore the views of patients taking part in a community-based undergraduate medical student project (the 'patient study') at Newcastle Medical School about their role as teachers of medical students, what they felt they had gained from participating, any problems or concerns and suggestions for change or improvement. Setting Newcastle Medical School, UK. Subjects Second-year medical students. Results Two major themes emerged. First, patients saw themselves in active roles as teachers: as experts in their medical condition; as exemplars of their condition; and as facilitators of the development of students' professional skills and attitudes. Secondly, patients felt they had benefited from participation, through talking about their problems; learning more about themselves; the satisfaction of helping; and from receiving gifts. In addition, a number of other issues were identified including interpersonal dynamics, gender and ethnic differences, inadequate briefing of participants and whether such community-based patient involvement might, in some situations, be felt to be exploitative. Conclusions The study has shown that patients see themselves clearly as having specific contributions to make to medical students' education and training. This has implications for the further development of community-based teaching.",121,121,Education & Educational Research; Health Care Sciences & Services

Until now, the knowledge of the immune response mechanism against S. agalactiae infection in tilapia has been limited. In the present study, the gill transcriptome of the tilapia from the GBS and the phosphate buffered saline (PBS) groups were sequenced. The transcriptomic analysis results presented the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at different time points (DEGs number, 6 h: 2122, 9 h: 1851, 15 h: 1791, and 18 h: 2395) after GBS injection, and significantly enriched immune-related gene ontology (GO) terms such as the innate immune response. The significantly enriched immune pathways included the Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, the nucleotide oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor signaling pathway, the cytosolic-DNA sensing pathway, and the intestinal immune network for Immunoglobulin A (IgA) production. Most of the DEGs in Toll-like receptor signaling, NOD-like receptor signaling, and cytosolic-DNA sensing pathways presented upregulations at 18 h, which indicated that the innate immune pathways were activated. Two immune-related pathways (phagosome and cell adhesion molecules) were significantly enriched at all time points, suggesting that these two pathways might also play important roles in the immune response against the GBS infection. The results of HE staining showed that the gills of tilapia were damaged seriously at 9 h post-infection, which might be due to the possibility of pyroptosis resulting from the changes of DEGs in the NOD-like receptor signaling pathway. This study provided new insight into the mechanisms of gill damage in fish infected with S. agalactiae.",0,0,Fisheries; Marine & Freshwater Biology

China is the world's largest producer and consumer of tobacco products. Although the prevalence of cigarette smoking declined from 34.5% to 27.7% between 1984 and 2015, the reduction over the 30 years has been slow. Therefore, effective tobacco regulatory policies are necessary. However, as the tobacco industry is one of the major sources of government revenue and an indispensable part of the national economy, the implementation of tobacco regulatory policies faces many challenges. In terms of the institutional dimension, the ambiguous attitude of national institutions and tobacco companies' development strategies impede the enforcement of tobacco policies. In addition, the primary economic barrier to tobacco control is the unwillingness of the government to raise value-added tax on tobacco. Finally, the social customs of exchanging individual cigarettes and gifting packaged cigarettes among adults and juveniles in China hinder the implementation of tobacco regulatory policies. In this case, a combined strategy of top-down and bottom-up approaches can remove these barriers, such as using the authoritative power to control tobacco use and raising non-smokers' awareness of smoking risks and public education.",4,4,Sociology

In North America, many medical faculties have introduced more stringent conflict of interest (COI) policies during the last decade. We asked whether similar steps had been taken in France. We hypothesized that such policies may have been introduced following a 2009-2010 drug safety scandal (benfluorex, Mediator) in which COIs in medicine received prominent press attention. Methods We searched the websites of all 37 French Faculties of Medicine in May 2015 for COI policies and curriculum, using standardized keyword searches. We also surveyed all deans of medicine on institutional COI policies and curriculum, based on criteria developed in similar US and Canadian surveys. Personal contacts were also consulted. We calculated a summary score per faculty based on 13 criteria. [range 0-26; higher scores denoting stronger policies] Results In total, we found that 9/37 (24%) of French medical schools had either introduced related curriculum or implemented a COI-related policy. Of these, only 1 (2.5%) had restrictive policies for any category. No official COI policies were found at any of the schools. However, at 2 (5%), informal policies were reported. The maximum score per faculty was 5/26, with 28 (76%) scoring 0. Conclusion This is the first survey in France to examine COI policies at medical faculties. We found little evidence that protection of medical students from undue commercial influence is a priority, either through institutional policies or education. This is despite national transparency legislation on industry financing of health professionals and limits on gifts. The French National Medical Students Association (ANEMF) has called for more attention to COI in medical education; our results strongly support such a call.",26,27,Science & Technology - Other Topics

Neuroimaging studies in adults suggest that the lateral prefrontal and parietal cortices play a crucial role in related cognitive activities including fluid reasoning, the control of attention, and working memory. Here, we investigated the neural bases for intellectual giftedness (superior-g) in adolescents, using fMRI. The participants consisted of a superior-g group (n = 18, mean RAPM = 33.9 +/- 0.8, > 99%) from the national academy for gifted adolescents and the control group (n = 18, mean RAPM 22.8 +/- 1.6, 60%) from local high schools in Korea (mean age = 16.5 +/- 0.8). MRI data were acquired while the.), performed two reasoning tasks with high and low g-loadings. In both groups, the high g-loaded tasks specifically increased regional activity in the bilateral fronto-parietal network including the lateral prefrontal, anterior cingulate, and posterior parietal cortices. However, the regional activations of the superior-g group were significantly stronger than those of the control group, especially in the posterior parietal cortex. Moreover, regression analysis revealed that activity of the superior and intraparietal cortices (BA 7/40) strongly covaried with individual differences in g (r = 0.71 to 0.81). A correlated vectors analysis implicated bilateral posterior parietal areas in g. These results suggest that superior-g may not be due to the recruitment of additional brain regions but to the functional facilitation of the fronto-parietal network particularly driven by the posterior parietal activation.

Intergenerational transfers from parents to their children are motivated by 'altruism'. We distinguish between two types of transfers: Investment of parents in the education of their offspring, and capital transfer (the 'gift-bequest motive'). We show that the intensity of each type of altruism, and hence the composition of the two types of transfers, affect significantly the equilibrium output and the intragenerational income distributions. Comparing competitive equilibria, from the same initial distributions of capital transfers and human capital, we derive: (a) The economy with the higher 'education-inclined' altruism attains lower output and more equal intragenerational income distributions, if either the production function's elasticity of substitution is not 'large' or the altruism is 'weak' (b) For more 'bequest-inclined' altruism the effects are, usually, reversed (c) Under public provision of education, higher (bequest-inclined) altruism results in lower output and less equal distribution of income in all dates.

Whether poverty causes differences in neurodevelopment, or is merely associated with factors that cause such differences, remains unclear. Here, we report estimates of the causal impact of a poverty reduction intervention on brain activity in the first year of life. We draw data from a subsample of the Baby's First Years study, which recruited 1,000 diverse low-income mother-infant dyads. Shortly after giving birth, mothers were randomized to receive either a large or nominal monthly unconditional cash gift. Infant brain activity was assessed at approximately 1 y of age in the child's home, using resting electroencephalography (EEG; n = 435). We hypothesized that infants in the high-cash gift group would have greater EEG power in the mid- to high-frequency bands and reduced power in a low-frequency band compared with infants in the low-cash gift group. Indeed, infants in the high-cash gift group showed more power in high-frequency bands. Effect sizes were similar in magnitude to many scalable education interventions, although the significance of estimates varied with the analytic specification. In sum, using a rigorous randomized design, we provide evidence that giving monthly unconditional cash transfers to mothers experiencing poverty in the first year of their children's lives may change infant brain activity. Such changes reflect neuroplasticity and environmental adaptation and display a pattern that has been associated with the development of subsequent cognitive skills.",49,49,Science & Technology - Other Topics

Therefore, this study aimed to identify and propose policy options for managing physician-pharmaceutical industry interactions in the context of Iran's health system. Methods: In the first phase, a systematic search was conducted to identify relevant policies and interventions in Web of Science, PubMed, and ProQuest databases from 2000 to 2022. Then, the opinions of the research team and an expert group (physicians, health policy and transparency experts, and industry representatives) were used to categorize the interventions and propose policy options along with their advantages, disadvantages, and implementation considerations.

We consider asking questions, especially studentgenerated questions, as indicators of quality of instructional interactions. In the part of the study presented in this paper, we explore instructional interactions in two high-school classes for mathematically promising students with specific focus on questions that students ask. The first class included generally gifted students (IQ >= 130) who were motivated to study mathematics at a high level (hereafter, a gifted class), and the second class included students characterized by high motivation regardless of their IQs (hereafter, motivation class). We analysed questions asked by the students during algebra and geometry lessons. Two types of questions are considered: elaboration and clarification. We found that students in a gifted class mostly asked elaboration questions, whereas students in a motivation class mostly asked clarification questions. We connect the revealed inclination to ask elaboration questions with intellectual curiosity that characterizes generally gifted students. Accordingly, we suggest that in classes of students who are motivated to study mathematics at high level, students who are generally gifted may create mathematical discourse of higher quality. We also argue that the identified differences in students' questions observed in classes of different types are not only student-dependent (i.e. depend on the students' levels of general giftedness) but can also be teacher-related and content-related.",8,8,Education & Educational Research

This article explores how Russian adolescents conceptualize and perceive feedback as an educational tool. Descriptive research was conducted using an anonymous survey based on a questionnaire composed of open-ended questions. Seven hundred and three adolescents from large cities of Russia were asked questions about how they understood feedback, what kind of feedback they would like to receive, and what kind of feedback they actually received from teachers. This was followed by a field study that involved an overt observation and analysis of feedback manifestations in a secondary school program for gifted students (n = 140). Most senior students understand the range of problems associated with feedback, yet they perceive feedback itself as a resource to be used by the teacher, not by themselves. In their beliefs about feedback, adolescents intuitively rely on either behavioral or existential perspective. In the former case, feedback is perceived only as an external stimulus and the resulting response. In the latter, students regard feedback as a tool for dialogue, support, engaged communication, relationship development, and direct or indirect request for evaluation or assistance. The more complex interpretation may stem from students' prior participation in situations of assistance and cooperation as well as their perceived need for a dialogue with the teacher or tutor. Since the sample was unrepresentative, the conclusions made in this study should be deemed preliminary.

The spatial analytical assessment was implemented as part of a battery of instruments to identify students to participate in a special internship program. Ratings of students on the spatial analytical assessment who were identified for the internship program using the new assessments were higher than ratings for students identified using conventional methods, which demonstrates that the assessment will be a useful tool for selecting students from diverse cultural groups.

In general, improvement in household income level is deemed to play an important role in promoting children's mental health. However, the impact and mechanism of household income status perception bias on children's mental health due to changes in the structure of household expenditure are under studied. On the basis of the perspective of household income status perception bias, we constructed a representative behavior household model of income status perception bias and a three-wave panel. We adopted the data from Chinese household tracking surveys in 2012, 2014, and 2016 to empirically analyze the mechanism and channel of household income status perception bias on children's mental health. Results reveal that: (1) A significant negative correlation exists between household income level and income status perception bias, and poor households are likely to have income status perception bias. (2) A significant positive correlation exists between income status perception bias of poor households and their gift-giving expenditure, whereas a negative correlation exists between income status perception bias and expenditure for children's education. The more the poor households overestimate their income status, the more inclined they are to increase their gift spending and reduce expenditure for children's education, thereby changing the structure of family expenditure. (3) A significant negative correlation exists between poor household income status perception bias and the mental health status of their children, whereas a positive correlation exists between household expenditure for children's education and children's mental health status. That is, the more that poor households overestimate their relative income status, the greater the mental pressure on children. Finally, the reduction of expenditure on children's education by rural households is an effective channel through which income status perception bias among poor households affects children's mental pressure.",2,2,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology

Entrepreneurial initiatives, emanating from the engineering school in the late 19th century, spread to the physical sciences in the 1930s and to the biological sciences and medicine by the 1970s. A concerted and compressed academic development strategy sought researchers with related interests across disciplines, assuming that teaching could be diversified from these critical cores. A multi-pronged financial strategy included attracting federal research funds, leasing university land, technology transfer income and endowment from gifts and equity in university-originated firms in varying past and future proportions. Bottom-up initiatives proliferated, filling technology transfer and start-up support gaps in the entrepreneurial ecosystem. Recently, some innovation initiatives have been shuttered as the Administration has tacked towards addressing climate change though a microscopic initiative. Given an institutionalized and legitimated culture and infrastructure of entrepreneurship and innovation, these dual institutional logics operate in tandem symbiosis, mutually fructifying each other.",2,2,Education & Educational Research

A combination of chemotaxonomic, cultural and morphological properties confirmed its position in the genus of Streptomyces. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequence analyses showed that the isolate was most closely related to Streptomyces leeuwenhoekii C34(T) (99.9% similarity) and loosely associated with the type strains of Streptomyces chiangmaiensis (98.7% similarity) and Streptomyces glomeratus (98.9% similarity). Multilocus sequence analyses based on five conserved housekeeping gene alleles confirmed the close relationship between the isolate and S. leeuwenhoekii C34(T), although both strains belonged to a well-supported Glade that encompassed the type strains of S. glomeratus, Streptomyces griseomycini, Streptomyces griseostramineus, Streptomyces labedae, Streptomyces lomondensis and Streptomyces spinoverrucosus. A comparison of the draft genome sequence generated for the isolate with corresponding whole genome sequences of its closest phylogenomic neighbours showed that it formed a well-separated lineage with S. leeuwenhoekii C34(T). These strains can also be distinguished using a combination of phenotypic properties and by average nucleotide identity and digital DNA-DNA hybridization similarities of 94.3 and 56%, values consistent with their classification in different species. Based on this wealth of data it is proposed that isolate PRKS01-65(T) (=NCIMB 15211(T)=CCMM B1302(T)=ICEBB-03(T)) be classified as Streptomyces harenosi sp. nov.

However, traditional Chinese culture widely regards the body as a gift from one's parents that should remain intact after death, resulting in a shortage of cadavers for medical training and research. This situation changed in Taiwan when Master Cheng Yen, the founder of the Buddhist Tzu Chi Medical Foundation, supported the donation of bodies to medical science. This study aimed to investigate the current situation of body donation in Taiwan, including donors' motivation and psychological characteristics. A questionnaire was conducted with 681 adult participants, including 336 people who pledged to donate their bodies to medical science after death and a control group comparable in age, gender, and level of education. All participants answered questions regarding anxiety over death, purpose in life, gratitude, altruism, and life satisfaction. In addition, the registered donor group answered questions regarding the motivation for donating their bodies to science. The main influencing factors were to help advance medical science, make a positive contribution to society, and release attachment from the body. Further, many male participants indicated the desire to reduce trouble and expenses that their families would incur in making funeral and burial or cremation arrangements. The main predictors of donating one's body to medical science were low anxiety concerning death, a high level of altruism, and gratitude.",0,0,Health Care Sciences & Services

Thirty-six Dutch gifted secondary-school students with either persistent (n = 18) or resolving (n = 18) dyslexia participated. Groups, matched on IQ, were assessed on dyslexia- and intelligence-related cognitive risk and protective factors. Findings for the risk factors showed support for both the resolving-deficit and compensatory-mechanism theories: Resolving and persistent groups were comparable on phoneme deletion and nonalphanumeric rapid automatized naming, but resolvers outperformed students with persistent dyslexia on spoonerisms and alphanumeric rapid automatized naming. For the protective factors, resolvers consistently showed more pronounced cognitive strengths in verbal areas relevant for literacy development, which is in line with the compensatory-mechanism theory.

We investigated age-related changes in male reproductive investment towards courtship display and the spermatophore in three age classes (young, middle-aged and old) of a monandrous moth, Ostrinia scapulalis. As predicted, old males had higher mating success than young and middle-aged males in no-choice tests. Moreover, two-choice tests revealed that middle-aged males had a higher success rate than young males because of their higher courtship frequency rather than any female preference for them. It was found that old males produced a larger spermatophore than young and middle-aged males, suggesting greater reproductive effort. The protein content of spermatophores also tended to increase with male age. Despite the age-related variation in spermatophore size and protein content, age did not affect female fecundity or longevity. A decrease in the number of sperm in the older males might counteract the nutritional benefit of larger spermatophores. Alternatively, fitness components other than longevity and fecundity may be influenced by male age.",18,20,Psychology; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology

In particular, we expected a close link between mathematical skills and the ability to reason independently of one's beliefs. Our results showed that this was indeed the case, with children with DD performing more poorly than controls, and high maths ability children showing outstanding skills in logical reasoning about belief-laden problems. Nevertheless, all groups performed poorly on structurally equivalent problems with belief-neutral content. This is in line with suggestions that abstract reasoning skills (i.e. the ability to reason about content without real-life referents) develops later than the ability to reason about belief-inconsistent fantasy content.A video abstract of this article can be viewed at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90DWY3O4xx8",39,40,Psychology

Furthermore, the effect of added water on the structure of host reverse micelles was also investigated. The scattering data were evaluated by the generalized indirect Fourier transformation (GIFT) method and model fittings. It was found that diglycerol polyisostearate (abbreviated as (iso-C-18)(n)G(2), where n = 2-4 represent the number of isostearate chain per surfactant molecule) spontaneously form reverse micelles in HD at 25 degrees C and their geometry (shape and size, and internal structure) could flexibly be controlled by a small change in the lipophilic tail architecture of the surfactant, temperature, and water addition. Increasing number of isostearate chain per surfactant molecule decreases the micelles size favoring prolate-to-sphere type transition. This phenomenon could be best understood due to voluminous lipophilic part of the surfactant. Increasing temperature decreases the size of the reverse micelles due to enhanced interpenetration of the surfactant chain and the oil and also due to dominant hydrophobic character of the surfactant at higher temperatures.

So there was a need to assess the views about accepting gifts and attitudes/influence towards drug promotion among community pharmacists in Punjab, Pakistan. Setting Adopting a preused questionnaire, we conducted a cross-sectional multiple-site survey study. We distributed questionnaires to pharmacists in the community pharmacies to investigate the exposure, scepticism and acceptance to drug promotion as well as their perception about the appropriateness of gifts and to check if they had been taught about dealing with medical representatives. Data were analysed in simple percentages, and the chi(2) test was used to evaluate association with demographics. All the analysis was done using SPSS V.23.0. Results A total 86.9% (463/533) pharmacists completed the survey. One out of four pharmacists reported being taught about the ethics of drug promotion (26.8%) and about how to interpret drug promotional material (25.0%) and were significantly associated with higher age (age 31%-35 years, 81.9%; p<0.05). More than two-thirds of the respondents found it appropriate to accept stationery (73.4%) and textbooks (70.6%) as gifts, and only 17.5% felt it was appropriate to accept direct money. Less than half of the pharmacists (47.3%) perceived drug companies were useful for gaining knowledge about new drugs. Majority (76.2%) thought these drug promotions play a role in the irrational prescribing of antibiotics and 18.6% dispensed antibiotics due to these promotions. Conclusion The majority of pharmacists participating in this study felt it was appropriate to receive small value gifts from pharmaceutical companies. Only a small proportion of the respondents was given ethical training and education about drug promotion. Improving the syllabus and updating the pharmacist's knowledge after graduation, as part of continued pharmacy education, will eventually improve the healthcare professionals' capability to act for the patients' welfare.",0,0,General & Internal Medicine

We developed field trip places by considering not only Orion (1993)'s novelty space but also the achievement standards of 2015 national curriculum. The subjects of the study were 8 in the 'G' science gifted education center. We conducted a study using the theme of 'How was formed Mt. Gwanak?' on 5 lessons including a series of 2 field trip lessons and 3 lessons utilizing the social construction of scientific model. Students participated in pre- and post-test on the understanding of scientific knowledge about formation of mountain. Semi-structured interview was used to analyze students' learning about geological field trip in terms of affective domain. Results were as follows. First, there were 2 places of upper-stream valley and down-stream valley separately. They contained outcrops gneiss, granite, joint in the valley, xenolith, fault plane, mineral in the valley. Second, pre- and post-test and semi-structure interview were analyzed in terms of what scientific knowledge students learned about and how Mt. Gwanak was formed. Seven students explained that Mt. Gwanak was volcano during pretest. Seven students described how granite was formed to form Mt. Gwanak. They also understood geological time scale, i.e., metamorphic rock. Third, the geological field trip was effective to low achievement geoscience students as they engaged in the activities of field trip. Using positive responses on affective learning was effective on learning on geological field trip when utilizing the social construction of scientific model. This study suggests that teachers use an example 'model' on geoscience education.

To explore this topic, the epistemological beliefs of six sophomores on the nature of physics knowledge in textbooks and their beliefs on the nature of the larger body of scientific knowledge were investigated through interviews. All participants were majoring in physics education and all thought that the larger body of scientific knowledge could be changed. Three categories were then introduced that classified how the students' understanding of the nature of scientific knowledge was linked with their learning behavior: 'receiving physics knowledge based on authority', 'receiving physics knowledge based on extrinsic motivation', and 'authentic understanding'. These categories were concerned with the acquisition of personal conceptions of mechanical energy. In particular, those students who pursued a superficial consistency and held a belief concerned with a definition of energy experienced a cognitive conflict with the conceptions of negative mechanical energy and a standard position.

A gifted physician, naturalist, anatomist, and scientific illustrator, Leidy made critical contributions across the entire range of the natural sciences. Widely respected and honored during his lifetime, Leidy was one of the last of the generation of Romantic naturalists-the great encyclopedists of the natural world. At the start of his career, scientific research in America largely was the domain of gentlemen amateurs and wealthy collectors; when he died, science and science education had moved into the realm of universities and research institutions, adopted a formal methodology, divided itself into specializations and, in large measure, had established itself as the modem discipline we know today. Leidy, perhaps more than any other American scientist, helped to guide and inspire this era of transition. Despite his prodigious achievements, his career has not been fully assessed or reconsidered since the early part of this century. The following biographical sketch is the result of research undertaken by the authors for a commemorative symposium which they organized in Philadelphia in October 1991 to recognize the enduring contributions of this remarkable scientist and teacher.

Male choice is often directed towards female phenotypes that are good indicators of fecundity such as body size, age, or virgin status, and often acts in the same direction as fecundity selection. In insects, only a few examples exist where male choice is directed towards female ornaments as proxies Butler of female quality. Here, we use dry season males of the sex-role reversed butterfly species Bicyclus anynana to test for differences in male choosiness and investment towards females of varying attractiveness using ornament-manipulations. Male reproductive investment in this species is in the form of a nuptial gift, a spermatophore, given to females upon mating. Males were placed in cages with either wild-type ornamented females or with nonornamented females (center of the dorsal forewing eyespots painted over), and time to mating, duration of mating, and longevity of males and females after a single mating were measured. Ornament manipulations consisted of blocking the UV-reflective scales in the center of the dorsal forewing eyespots of females, a known sexual ornament. Males displayed lower latency to mate and longer mating durations with ornamented females. The longer mating duration did not, however, translate in the transfer of a nuptial gift that increased female longevity or reduced male longevity. Instead, we propose that longer mating durations with ornamented females may represent increased mate guarding behavior or increased sperm transfer.",8,8,Entomology

It was argued that Classical Ghanaian Pentecostal Churches' leadership is based on the Fivefold Ministry (Apostle, Prophet, Evangelist, Pastor and Teacher). These leadership functions were therefore discussed in the light of their missiological implication. The conclusion arrived at is that it is not enough to discover one's spiritual gift or calling; these gifts should be developed and nurtured through mentoring and proper theological education, with the ultimate purpose being to participate in the Missio Dei.",3,3,Religion

Physicians' attitudes towards the industry can form early in their careers, but little is known about this key stage of development. Methods and Findings: We performed a systematic review reported according to PRISMA guidelines to determine the frequency and nature of medical students' exposure to the drug industry, as well as students' attitudes concerning pharmaceutical policy issues. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and ERIC from the earliest available dates through May 2010, as well as bibliographies of selected studies. We sought original studies that reported quantitative or qualitative data about medical students' exposure to pharmaceutical marketing, their attitudes about marketing practices, relationships with industry, and related pharmaceutical policy issues. Studies were separated, where possible, into those that addressed preclinical versus clinical training, and were quality rated using a standard methodology. Thirty-two studies met inclusion criteria. We found that 40%-100% of medical students reported interacting with the pharmaceutical industry. A substantial proportion of students (13%-69%) were reported as believing that gifts from industry influence prescribing. Eight studies reported a correlation between frequency of contact and favorable attitudes toward industry interactions. Students were more approving of gifts to physicians or medical students than to government officials. Certain attitudes appeared to change during medical school, though a time trend was not performed; for example, clinical students (53%-71%) were more likely than preclinical students (29%-62%) to report that promotional information helps educate about new drugs. Conclusions: Undergraduate medical education provides substantial contact with pharmaceutical marketing, and the extent of such contact is associated with positive attitudes about marketing and skepticism about negative implications of these interactions. These results support future research into the association between exposure and attitudes, as well as any modifiable factors that contribute to attitudinal changes during medical education.",77,81,General & Internal Medicine

Indeed, participating in a physical education high ability class results in lower physical education self-evaluations. However, according to Social Identity Theory, this typical social comparison effect of high ability groupings can be counterbalanced by social identification to such a positively valued group. Methods: About 46 French physically gifted students participating in a high ability class and in traditional heterogeneous classes. Physical education self-evaluation and social identification (perceived class status, self-categorisation) with the class are repetitively collected during a 1-year period. Results: Students show different variations of self-evaluations but similar final self-evaluations in the two groupings. In the high ability class, a strong positive social identification effect occurs but decreases during the year. Self-categorisation mainly explains the variation of self-evaluation in the high ability class. Conclusions: Homogeneous groupings do not undermine self-evaluations of physically gifted students in as much as they are aware of their class status and categorise themselves in comparison to this group. The decrease of self-evaluations in the high ability class is explained by a progressive lack of self-categorisation in comparison to the high ability class.

The proposed program will encourage students to solve real-life problems through a creative thinking spiral related to cognitive skills with computer programming. With the goal of enhancing digital fluency through this proposed training program, we investigated its effects. Two sets of experiments were performed in which 119 typical students and 30 younger, gifted students participated. Two synthetic creative problem solving tests, which had a high correlation with logical ability, scientific problem solving ability and divergent thinking ability, were developed to measure creative problem solving ability. We provided the treatment group with a paper-based booklet with relevant problems developed specifically for that group. ANCOVA statistical procedures were used to analyze the pre- and post-synthetic creative problem solving tests. The findings of our study are as follows: with typical students, the originality of the treatment group outperformed the control group, a result that was compatible with previous research. With gifted students, the fluency of the treatment group outperformed the control group, and overall creative problem solving ability was enhanced. Remarkably, fluency increased significantly, a notable difference from the results of prior studies. In conclusion, we inferred that, given the definition of digital fluency, if creative problem solving ability is enhanced by a training program for creative problem solving based on computer programming, digital fluency will ultimately be improved. In this paper, we discuss the result of fluency enhancement that contradicts prior research. We suggest that this training program could be a new learning environment for the students who have grown up with digital media.",14,14,Psychology

The costs to males associated with the production of manipulative traits have received relatively little attention. In numerous insects, including bushcrickets (Orthoptera: Tettigoniidae), males are known to transfer substances in the ejaculate that inhibit the receptivity of females to further matings in a dose-dependent manner. The aim of this study was to test the prediction that, across bushcricket taxa, larger ejaculates and nuptial gifts will be associated with, on the one hand, longer sexual refractory periods in females and, on the other hand, longer sexual refractory periods in males. Data on the duration of the sexual refractory period in both males and females, together with ejaculate mass, spermatophylax mass, and male body mass, were obtained for 23 species of bushcricket. Both comparative analysis by independent contrasts and species regression revealed a positive relationship, across taxa, between the duration of the female's sexual refractory period and both relative ejaculate mass and relative nuptial gift mass. Positive relationships were also found between the duration of the male's sexual refractory period and both relative ejaculate mass and relative nuptial gift mass, indicating that there is a trade-off between resources spent on spermatophore size and the male's potential mating rate. This appears to be the first comparative evidence that there is a cost to males associated with manipulating the remating behavior of their mates.",38,41,Behavioral Sciences; Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Zoology

The current study aims to explore distress and coping strategies in Indonesian T2DM outpatients in a Primary Healthcare Centre (PHC) in Surabaya, East Java, Indonesia. Methods We conducted a qualitative study using two different data collection methods: focus group discussions and in-depth interviews. The guideline of interviews and discussions were developed based on seventeen questions derived from the DDS17 Bahasa Indonesia (a Bahasa Indonesia version of the Diabetes Distress Scale questionnaire), which covered physician distress domain, emotional burden domain, regimen distress domain and interpersonal distress domain. Results The majority of the 43 participants were females and aged 50 or older. Our study discovered two main themes: internal and external diabetes distress and coping strategies. Internal diabetes distress consists of disease burden, fatigue due to T2DM, fatigue not due to T2DM, emotional burden (fear, anxiety, etc.) and lack of knowledge. Internal coping strategies comprised spirituality, positive attitude, acceptance and getting more information about T2DM. External diabetes distress was evoked by distress concerning healthcare services, diet, routine medication, monthly blood sugar checks, interpersonal distress (family) and financial concern. External coping strategies included healthcare support, traditional medicine, vigilance, self-management, social and family support and obtaining information about health insurance. Conclusion Our study shows that for Indonesian T2DM-patients, spirituality and acceptance are the most common coping mechanisms for reducing DD. Furthermore, our study revealed an overall positive attitude towards dealing with T2DM as well as a need for more information about T2DM and potential coping strategies. Finally, an important finding of ours relates to differences in DD between males and females, potential DD associated with health services provision and the specific challenges faced by housewives with T2DM.",11,11,"Health Care Sciences & Services; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"

Therefore melliniite provides new and important information about the chemical interaction in transition metal chalcogenides and possibly pnictides.

The project is designed as a small group apprenticeship for gifted high school juniors or seniors who can spend full time in a sponsor's laboratory for at least 1 week. The students begin by examining evidence from a mock crime scene that consists of hair samples from the crime scene and from five potential suspects. Students extract DNA from the hair samples and amplify a hypervariable region within the mitochondrial genome using the polymerase chain reaction. Amplified products are then sequenced and compared with the crime scene sequence using DNA alignment software. In consecutive projects, students from four different schools successfully identified the suspect who Matched the crime scene evidence. This project is a valuable learning tool not only due to the comprehensive introduction to molecular biology techniques but also because it helps the students to connect scientific exploration with well publicized media events and provides a window into potential career opportunities in the field of molecular biology.",6,6,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Education & Educational Research

The historical changes are usually referred by some key terms, like, mechanics' institutes, object lessons, heuristics, general science, inquiry, STS, misconceptions. To characterize these changes, science educators frequently use some slogan-like analogies referring parts of human body to indicate the movement of science education during a particular period of time: for example, 'Hands-On' for inquiry movement during 1960s-70s, 'Minds-On' for constructivist movement during 1980s-90s. In this paper, I briefly summarize the overall historical development of science education, then further expand the analogies to cover the overall process, that is, Ears-On -> Eyes-On -> Hands-On -> Minds-On. In addition, to illustrate new directions of the 21st century, I propose a new analogy, 'Hearts-On' science education, and also discuss the meanings and implications of 'Hearts-On' analogy by illustrating how this analogy can be applied to reflect various current trends in science education.",0,0,Education & Educational Research

A case study",ANNALES MEDICO-PSYCHOLOGIQUES,Adolescents; Giftedness; Psychological; assessment; Psychopathology; Schooling,DISORDERS; ATTENTION; ANXIETY; FAMILY,"Introduction. - With a prevalence of 2.3% among French schoolchildren aged 6 to 16, giftedness represents a challenge in child psychiatry (Delaubier, 2002). Dys-synchronies can appear in the different domains of intelligence, associated with eclectic symptoms: hypersensitivity, anxiety, depression, attention deficit disorder with or without hyperactivity, oppositional disorder as well as conduct disorders. The psychological assessment can constitute an opportunity to identify and evaluate giftedness functioning in order to advise an adapted treatment in the guidance of these children and teenagers, and to guarantee them the most harmonious global development.Method. - The method used was that of a case study. was received within clinical research carried out at the University of Bordeaux for the realization of a psychological assessment. The objective of the assessment was to investigate and understand the polymorphic anxiety domain but also the impossibility for Minerva to attend middle school, with the result that she was home schooled with the National Center for Distance Learning (CNED). Over two half-days, we were able to successively carry out the anamnestic interview, a semi-structured interview, the K-SADS, the evaluation of cognitive functioning with the WISC-V, various projective tests such as the TAT, the Rorschach test, a drawing of a man and a family, as well as various scales in self and hetero-evaluation.Results. - The K-SADS clarified the psychopathological situation as well as the family, social and school impact of this invasive case of anxiety. The results of the WISC-V showed an intellectual potential between 117 and 129, with areas of high efficiency for the Verbal Comprehension Index (VCI = 146) and the Working Memory Index (WMI = 122). The profile, although not reaching the recommended 130 in global IQ, is consistent with high intellectual potential when the performance is impacted by the situation of parasitic anxiety and a sedative medication. The projective tests as well as the drawings of the man and the family, demonstrated the extent of the considerable rigid defense mechanisms and of avoidance, but also of the hyper investment of the intellectualization processes. Conclusion. - The screening of high intellectual potential represents a clinical challenge in view of the lack of diagnostic recommendations as well as the disparity of information accumulated in research on their characteristics. The holistic approach of the psychological assessment appears to be a solution allowing to situate the individual's psychic functioning in a constitutive zone of the high intellectual potential profile, which should also be at the service of the global therapeutic management. @ 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The contact with gifted children and an individual course of teaching require various types of competence from teachers: music, didactic and psychological. Communicative skills, knowledge of individual phases of psychophysical development of a young person, an effective motivation for regular practice, as well as constant reflection on one's own professional development are necessary elements of everyday work of a music teacher. Whether individual teachers are able to optimally perform their duties obviously depends not only on their education, but also on their personality, social competence, ability to create optimal relations both with students, parents and other teachers. The article presents the results of a qualitative study concerning selected aspects of work of music instrument teachers in Polish music schools. The research issues are formulated as the following questions: What are the opinions of the respondents on their competence? What psycho pedagogical problems do the surveyed teachers perceive in their work? What would the respondents change in the functioning of Polish music schools? The conclusion puts forward proposals concerning optimization of the educational process with reference to teacher competence, comprehensive student development and, consequently, optimization of the process of teaching young musicians.",0,0,Arts & Humanities - Other Topics

As part of a nationwide talent identification program led by UNK (New Generation Centre, Hungary of Talents Program, 2016-2020), we developed an online rating tool with which teachers could indicate the talent areas of their 5th grade students. Through several iterations-involving the translation, application, and analysis of Renzulli's Scales for Rating the Behavioral Characteristics of Superior Students questionnaire and a custom-made normative questionnaire-we developed a matrix-style competency rating instrument called TalentTiles. The primary aim of the instrument is to collect more realistic and reliable teacher-ratings on students. The instrument takes a very short time-less than 2 minutes per student-to complete, focuses on the behavioral characteristics, measures school-related areas, addresses general competencies (e.g., ability, motivation) in a domain-specific way and has low average inter-item correlations. After the first pilot test TalentTiles seems to be an innovative and user friendly way of collecting teachers' opinions about school-related gifted behavior. (c) 2019 The Authors.

One of the most recent technologies that have captured the attention of many educators around the world is Web 2.0, which is also known as the read-write web. We have to face it there is very little off-line writing or reading any more. A small minority still actually read or write in a traditional way. Under such circumstances the teachers have to adapt and to use the same learning support or creative tools as the largest number of young generation. Youth with writing talent display distinguishing characteristics and those characteristics can be supported and enhanced using Web 2.0 tools. Online writing communities can help students connect with other writers and can offer motivational challenges such as contests and publication opportunities. Resources are available for writers of varying ages and interests; features include moderated discussions and commenting, online and hard-copy publication options, peer models, multimedia integration, as well as collaboration. Using Web 2.0 tools, teachers can promote a writing education that not only meets 21st-century standards but also effectively meets the needs of talented writers. When all students - not just those who are gifted - feel that they have ownership in their writings or publications and have a sense of belonging to a literacy community, talent development occurs naturally, making the teacher's job easier. When used wisely, Web 2.0 tools can provide authentic learning experiences for the young writers in their own classroom. This paper working hypothesis is that primary school students' writing competence and creativity can be increased by using the largest number of sources offered by the digital world.",1,1,Education & Educational Research

Methods From August to December 2021, vaccinated PAs aged >= 18 years who could provide informed consent were recruited during vaccination events for same-day participation. Events were held at encampments, service providers (eg, housing agencies, food lines, and mobile showers), and roving locations around Los Angeles. PAs were asked to join outreach alongside community health workers and shared their experience getting vaccinated, receiving a $25 gift card for each hour they participated. Postevent surveys evaluated how many PAs enrolled and how long they participated. In October 2021, we added a preliminary effectiveness evaluation of how many additional vaccinations were attributable to PAs. Staff who enrolled the PAs estimated the number of additional people vaccinated because of talking with the PA. Results A total of 117 PAs were enrolled at 103 events, participating for an average of 2 hours. At events with the effectiveness evaluation, 197 additional people were vaccinated over 167 PA hours ($21.19 gift card cost per additional person vaccinated), accounting for >25% of all vaccines given at these events.

Environmental impact is a major problem for the sustainable development of companies. The economic quantitative statements are based on the erroneous assumption of a steady natural environment. This fact is induced by the predominant use of commutative linear classic logics. When the environment becomes unstable and resources become exhaustible, more complex situations arise. These complex situations can no longer be assessed by classical mechanisms but through instruments developed by complexity sciences. The sustainability mechanisms are no longer linear but complex and are based on the liaison method of the information flow and data or material accumulation described in this study. For the purpose of this paper, it has launched a fundamental research based on the normative analysis of the eco-efficiency definition, considered from the environmental impact on the unit measure perspective. The model is based on triangulated feedback structures containing a Source, a Sensor and a Decision-maker, as well as a portfolio of possible relationships between the three components. Through the triangulated feedback structure, the Decision-maker can act through successive iterations, until the objective is met. To design the crisis management eco-efficient model, financial and nonfinancial information must be assigned to the Source, and the management decisions to the Decision-maker. The Sensor is represented successively or integrated through social and environmental factors that influence the measurement and recognition of eco-efficiency, under crisis circumstances. The conceptual management framework is derived through a deductive approach to the research in the context of correlated crises eco-efficient modelling. Through this deductive approach a conceptual framework of corporate management from the correlated crises eco-efficient modelling perspective is provided. The post-normal approach of the model discloses and provides effective solutions for the correlated crises eco-efficient management.",0,0,Business & Economics

In this species, males have a bright iridescent blue field on the dorsal hindwing surface, while females have little or no dorsal iridescence. Females preferentially mate with males who display a bright and highly chromatic blue field on their dorsal hindwing. In this study, we show that the chroma of the blue field on the male dorsal hindwing and male body size (forewing length) significantly predict the mass of material or spermatophore that a male forms within the female's copulatory sac during mating. We also found that spermatophore mass correlated negatively with copulation duration, but that color variables did not significantly predict this potential direct benefit. These results suggest that females may enhance the material benefits they receive during mating by mating with males based on the coloration of their dorsal hindwing.",10,10,Science & Technology - Other Topics

Results of the optional Extended Exam in Mathematics (EEM) serve as the main criterion in entering tertiary education in majority of technical and engineering majors and, therefore, the exam works as an important filter for future career paths. We investigate whether the wide, gross difference between men and women in the propensity to take EEM can be mostly explained by an underlying skill difference, school effects, or other non-cognitive factors. We also test a skill immunization hypothesis which predicts that the gender gap declines at higher levels of mathematical skill. For those purposes we use official data from the 2016 matriculation exams covering the complete cohort of a quarter of a million students in more than 5000 schools. The results show that with skill and school effects roughly held constant, women are still much less likely to take EEM and the gender gap does not narrow on the upper tail of performance in mathematics. Furthermore, higher verbal skill draws women away from pursuing mathematics more strongly than it draws away men. These combined results imply that non-cognitive factors play a key role in self-selection processes and that STEM majors are at higher risk of losing mathematically gifted women than mathematically gifted men.",3,3,Psychology; Women's Studies

Three months later, at Time 2, children completed the same set of tasks. Parental responsiveness was coded from the parent-child free play sessions, and parental directive language was coded from transcripts of a subset of 127 of these sessions. Structural equation modelling was used, and covariates included age, gender, language skills, parental education, and Time 1 delay inhibition. Results indicated that in separate models, Time 1 parental directive language was significantly negatively associated with Time 2 delay inhibition, and Time 1 parental responsiveness was significantly positively associated with Time 2 delay inhibition. When these parenting factors were entered simultaneously, Time 1 parental directive language significantly predicted Time 2 delay inhibition whereas Time 1 parental responsiveness was no longer significant.

The article undertakes a review of the literature and takes note of the practice of students taking an oath prior to dissecting cadavers whereby they reflect on their conduct and habits in the dissection room. It emphasizes the guidelines adopted by medical schools to ensure respectful handling of human cadavers during dissection and highlights traditional ways to honor them followed in some parts of the world. The article attempts to focus on the noble endeavor of funeral ceremonies to pay homage to the departed soul who enlightened the students with the knowledge of human anatomy. Finally it converges on the memorial services incorporated into anatomy programs to instill in students an appreciation of the humanity of those who went under the knife as a service to mankind. Based on the observations made in the present study some recommendations are also proposed regarding good practices in human cadaveric dissection.

These links with delaying gratification appear from early childhood and have been explained by cognitive and social factors that help override tendencies toward immediate gratification. However, some tendencies may actually promote delaying gratification. We assessed children's delaying gratification for different rewards across two cultures that differ in customs around waiting. Consistent with our preregistered prediction, results showed that children in Japan (n = 80) delayed gratification longer for food than for gifts, whereas children in the United States (n = 58) delayed longer for gifts than for food. This interaction may reflect cultural differences: Waiting to eat is emphasized more in Japan than in the United States, whereas waiting to open gifts is emphasized more in the United States than in Japan. These findings suggest that culturally specific habits support delaying gratification, providing a new way to understand why individuals delay gratification and why this behavior predicts life success.",11,10,Psychology

Spatial concepts are of significant importance in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education including physics, chemistry, geoscience, and biology, as well as most branches of engineering. Spatial concepts are also important in the military. For example, sand tables are used to understand the terrain, since calculating Line of Sight (LOS) for cover and concealment on the battlefield can mean the difference between life or death. In addition, land navigation using topographic maps is a critical skill that all members of the military are required to obtain. For this work in progress, the Army Research Laboratory (ARL) and Northwestern University, a member of SILC, are exploring sketching technologies to support spatial learning, as part of on-going research in adaptive training technologies. ARL's Generalized Intelligent Framework for Tutoring (GIFT) provides a software platform for developing intelligent tutoring systems. Adaptive learning, where the state of the learner is used to help select their path through activities, has been shown to improve learning. As part of our on-going research, we are in the process of integrating sketch worksheets into GIFT as a new type of instructional media. Sketch worksheets were designed to be general-purpose and use artificial intelligence to provide immediate feedback to students performing sketching assignments. To facilitate dissemination, an authoring environment was created for domain experts and instructors, to enable them to create new worksheets.

In this form of education children are taught by their parents. This education is primarily based on the use of printed materials. Electronic materials tend to be used only as supplements to more traditional teaching methods, despite the fact that home schooling is a perfect platform for e-learning. This paper presents a case study of the first school in the Czech Republic that provides distance education in the form of e-learning for Czech and Slovak home schoolers. Children enrolled at this school not only have the chance to use traditional and electronic learning materials, they can also consult on questions and queries with their teachers online. The paper discusses the legislative frame in which this sort of distance learning is set and looks at the different learning methods and techniques, the methods used to assess students, and makes a current evaluation of the whole process. Attention is paid to the e-learning environment and different forms of e-learning support that this school provides to its pupils and their parents. The project presented here in the form of a case study is an innovative example of good practice showing how e-learning and distance learning can be used efficiently with children of primary school age, i.e. an age group among whom distance education is not usual. Distance education is a solution not only for parents interested in home schooling but also for parents of gifted children and children with health disabilities. It enables the provision of centralised support, i.e. one centre can provide teaching to children that are very distant from each other. The school we present here provides e-learning support to about one-quarter of Czech home schoolers. We believe that the practices of the school described in this paper could serve as a good model for other schools in different parts of the world and be a valuable source of information for researchers interested in e-learning aimed at children of primary school age.",4,4,Education & Educational Research

This is the first study in the Baltic countries describing exposure and attitudes of medical, pharmacy and nursing students towards cooperation with industry. Methods A cross-sectional on-line survey of current medical, pharmacy and nursing students (n = 918) in three Baltic countries was carried out. Results We found that most students participate in events organized or sponsored by industry and accept a range of gifts and benefits. Students in the Baltic countries consider cooperation with industry important; at the same time, most do not feel that they have sufficient training on how to ethically interact with pharmaceutical and medical device companies and believe that these interactions can influence their prescribing or dispensing patterns. There is a tendency to rationalize cooperation with industry by referring to the current economic situation and patient benefits. Pharmacy students have higher rates of participation and they accept gifts and other benefits more often than nursing or medical students; therefore, they are likely to be more vulnerable to potential industry influence. Conclusions The findings highlight the need to include topics on ethics and conflicts of interests in cooperation with industry in curriculum of health care students in Baltic countries. Without proper training, students continue to be at risk to industry influence and may develop habits for their further practice differing from evidence-based practice in prescribing and dispensing of medicines, as well as use of medical devices.",1,1,Education & Educational Research

The two main components of the talent search model are discovery (identification) and development (programming) of academic talent. Discovery of academically talented elementary and middle school students occurs via the process of above-level testing, usually offered through university-based centers. The essence of talent search program intervention is acceleration, which has robust research support as the most effective intervention for high-ability students. Whereas talent search identification and programming are university based, talent search participants receive nearly all of their instruction in K-12 settings, where academic acceleration is less likely to be implemented. In this investigation, a large sample of talent search participants (n = 5,844) were asked questions designed to measure the various ways in which the students study mathematics, science, and language arts (writing and reading) in the K-12 setting.

In the course of the workshops held under the Ministry, these problems were discussed with the participation of the experts and a new diagnostic approach was tried to be found with the solution recommended. This search resulted in a new BILSEM Music Diagnostic Exam that combined dynamics such as contemporary special talent theories, objective measurement and evaluation principles, equal opportunities with the opportunities offered by music technology and was applied for the first time in Turkey with its original content in 2018. This exam will also make possible new opportunities with the use of smart technologies in the future. This study aims to introduce the technological transformation-based development process, content and applications of the BILSEM Music Diagnostic Exam after 2018.",0,0,Computer Science; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Engineering

Individual achievement, on the other hand, predicts academic self-concept and career aspirations positively. Research from Western and developed countries implies that the negative contextual effect on career aspirations is mediated by academic self-concept. Using data from the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2006 (a total of 398,750 15-year-old students from 57 countries), we test the generalizability of this mediation model in science using a general multilevel structural equation modeling framework. Individual achievement was positively related to academic self-concept (52 countries) and career aspirations (42 countries). The positive effect on career aspirations was mediated by self-concept in 54 countries. The negative effects of school-average achievement on self-concept (50 countries) and career aspirations (31 countries) also generalized well. After controlling for self-concept at both the individual and the school level, there were significant indirect contextual effects in 34 countries-evidence for mediation of the contextual effect of school-average achievement on career intentions by academic self-concept.",159,160,Psychology

Design/methodology/approach - The authors followed a qualitative case study design to explore the experiences of school stakeholders (e.g. students, district and school personnel and community partners) associated with the implementation of the career academy (Stake, 2006; Yin, 1994). Findings - The authors found that the school relied heavily on the support of the community in the form of an advisory board - including university faculty and industry leaders - to actively develop culturally responsive strategies (e.g. American College Test preparation, work-based learning opportunities) to ensure the success of black students interested in pursuing career pathways in engineering. Thus, school stakeholders in the academy of engineering served as authentic leaders who inspired academy students by serving as role models and setting examples through what they do as engineering professionals. It was quite evident that the joy and fulfillment that these authentic leaders gained from using their talents directly or indirectly inspired students in the academy to seek out and cultivate the talents they are good at and passionate about as well (Debebe, 2017). Moreover, the career academy provided environmental or sociocultural conditions that promoted the development of learners' gifts and talents (Plucker and Barab, 2005). Within that context, the goals of career academy school stakeholders were to support students in the discovery of what they are good at doing and to structure their educational experiences to cultivate their gifts into talents. Research limitations/implications - It is also important to acknowledge that this study is not generalizable to the one million career academy students across the nation. Yet, the authors believe researchers should continue to examine the career academy advisory board as a source of capital for engaging and preparing diverse learners for success post-high school. Further research is needed to investigate how advisory boards support students' in school and postsecondary outcomes, particularly for diverse students. Practical implications - The authors highlight promising practices for schools to implement in establishing a diverse talent pipeline. Social implications - On a theoretical level, the authors found important insights into the possibility of black students benefiting from a culturally responsive advisory board that provided social and cultural capital (e.g. aspirational, navigational and social) resources for their success. Originality/value - While prior researchers have studied the positive impact of teachers in career academies as a contributor to social capital for students (Lanford and Maruco, 2019) and what diverse students bring to the classroom as a form of capital Debebe(Yosso, 2005), research has not identified the role of the advisory board (in its efforts to connect the broader community) as a vehicle for equipping ethnically and racially diverse students who come from economically disadvantaged backgrounds with social capital. Within that sense, the authors believe the advisory board at Stanton Academy relied on what the authors term local community capital to provide resources and supports for black students' successful transition from high school into science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)-related college and career pathways.",1,1,Business & Economics

This is important to better understand their complexity and thus offer a more appropriate educational programs. There are rather few empirical works which attempt to identify high abilities profiles (giftedness and talent) that actually exist beyond the theoretical level. The present work intends to single out the different patterns or profiles resulting from the combination of the successful intelligence abilities (analytical, synthetic and practical), as defined by Stenberg. A total of 431 students from the Region of Murcia participated in this study. These students performed the Aurora Battery tasks (Chart, Grigorenko, & Sternberg, 2008), designed to measure the analytical, practical and creative intelligence. Analytically gifted students (n=27), practically gifted (n=33) and creatively gifted (n=34) were identified, taking as criteria scores equal to or higher than 120 IQ on each intelligence. Different Q-factor analyses were carried out for the three groups of students, in such a way that students were grouped according to their similarities. A total of 10 profiles showing how successful intelligence abilities are combined were obtained, something that has made possible to support the theory put forward by Sternberg (2000): the analytical, practical and creative talent profiles, as well as the resulting combinations, the analytical-practical, analytical-creative, practical-creative profiles, along with the consummate balance talent (high performance in the three types of intelligence).",4,13,Psychology

Objective To measure third-year medical students' exposure to and attitudes about drug company interactions. Design, Setting, and Participants In 2003, we distributed a 64-item anonymous survey to 1143 third-year students at 8 US medical schools, exploring their exposure and response to drug company interactions. The schools' characteristics included a wide spectrum of ownership types, National Institutes of Health funding, and geographic locations. In 2005, we conducted a national survey of student affairs deans to measure the prevalence of school-wide policies on drug company-medical student interactions. Main Outcome Measures Monthly frequency of students' exposure to various activities and gifts during clerkships, and attitudes about receiving gifts. Results Overall response rate was 826/1143 (72.3%), with range among schools of 30.9%-90.7%. Mean exposure for each student was 1 gift or sponsored activity per week. Of respondents, 762/818 (93.2%) were asked or required by a physician to attend at least 1 sponsored lunch. Regarding attitudes, 556/808 (68.8%) believed gifts would not influence their practices and 464/804 (57.7%) believed gifts would not affect colleagues' practices. Of the students, 553/604 (80.3 %) believed that they were entitled to gifts. Of 183 students who thought a gift valued at less than $50 was inappropriate, 158 (86.3%) had accepted one. The number of students who simultaneously believed that sponsored grand rounds are educationally helpful and are likely to be biased was 452/758 (59.6%). Students at 1 school who had attended a seminar about drug company-physician relationships were no more likely than the nonattending classmates to show skepticism. Of the respondents, 704/822 (85.6%) did not know if their school had a policy on these relationships. In a national survey of student affairs deans, among the 99 who knew their policy status, only 10 (10.1 %) reported having school-wide policies about these interactions. Conclusions Student experiences and attitudes suggest that as a group they are at risk for unrecognized influence by marketing efforts. Research should focus on evaluating methods to limit these experiences and affect the development of students' attitudes to ensure that physicians' decisions are based solely on helping each patient achieve the greatest possible benefit.",138,139,General & Internal Medicine

In case of heterothallic lichen-forming fungi, disturbances may lead to unbalanced gene frequency and patchy distribution of mating types, thus inhibiting sexual reproduction and imposing clonality. The impact of disturbance on reproductive strategies and genetic diversity of clonal systems has so far received little attention. To infer the effects of disturbances on mating-type allele frequencies and population structure, we selected three populations in the Parc Jurassien Vaudois (Switzerland), which were affected by uneven-aged forestry, intensive logging and fire, respectively. We used microsatellite markers to infer genetic diversity, allelic richness and clonal diversity of the epiphytic lichen Lobaria pulmonaria and used L. pulmonaria-specific MAT1-1 and MAT1-2 markers to analyse the frequency and distribution of mating types of 889 individuals. Our study shows that stand-replacing disturbances affect the mating-type frequency and distribution, thus compromising the potential for sexual reproduction. The fire-disturbed area had a significantly lower genetic and genotypic diversity and a higher clonality. Furthermore, the majority of compatible mating pairs in this area were beyond the effective vegetative dispersal range of the species. We conclude that stand-replacing disturbances lead to lower chances of sex and symbiont reshuffling and thus have long-lasting negative consequences on the reproductive strategies and adaptive potential of epiphytic lichen symbioses.",21,21,Microbiology

These heroes are deeply immersed in European liberal education, the 'Western Canon' to recall Harold Bloom; however, they are marginalized, alienated, degraded and eventually rejected by the masses, junk culture, the dictatorship of the commonplace, and the unqualified individual. Bellow's heroes predict that American culture will be overwhelmed by mass culture after the 1950s characterized by liberal democracy, [ultra capitalism], scientific experimentation, and industrialization, inspite of the high rate of higher education. Deploring a Derridean method of deconstructionism and a Foucauldian epistemic design, they archeologically question the roots of American cultural backdrop, that is, the massive industrialization in the late age of capitalism. They centralize art, humanities, classical books, morality, and religion; and marginalize science, commodity, consumerism, technology, and psychiatry. They deconstruct all makers of culture industry based on analysis, systemization, standardization, and not imagination and creativity. To achieve human and noble norms, they admit a noble life away from the vulgarity and barbarism of the age to cite Zygmunt Bauman.

Methods: Two phases were conducted based on the action cycle in the knowledge to action model. During the first phase, a framework was constructed by analyzing nursing experience. The second phase consisted of the implementation and monitoring of the program to evaluate the effects of the framework. Results: The main results for nursing competencies for pressure injury management in nursing homes are integrated thinking, understanding in an environmental context, interpersonal relationships for efficient decision making, and meeting any challenges to professional development. The results concerning the program's effects showed significant differences in the participants' knowledge, attitude, stage discrimination ability, and clinical management judgment ability.

This non-pharmacological method of pain relief originated in the USSR and became well known as the Lamaze method in western English-speaking countries. Use of the method in Czechoslovakia, however, followed a very different path from both the West, where its use was refined mainly outside the biomedical frame, and the USSR, where it ceased to be pursued as a scientific method in the 1950s after Stalin's death. The method was imported to Czechoslovakia in the early 1950s and it was politically promoted as Soviet science's gift to women. In the 1960s the method became widespread in practice but research on it diminished and, in the 1970s, its use declined too. However, in the 1980s, in the last decade of the Communist regime, the method resurfaced in the pages of Czechoslovak medical journals and underwent an exciting renaissance, having been reintroduced by a few enthusiastic individuals, most of them women.

Characterizations revealed that this unique route endowed mesoporous Co3O4@CN with good hydrophilicity, thus promoting its adsorption capacity towards both pollutants and PMS. Furthermore, Co3O4@CN demonstrated high activity for fast ciprofloxacin (CIP) degradation.

Why do some people with type 2 diabetes thrive in the face of adversity and disruption while others remain apathetic or succumb to destructive behaviors? Many researchers focus on the risk factors and barriers to diabetes management rather than explore the resilient qualities that keep people thriving. Optimal diabetes care requires an emotionally healthy patient. Methods A review of the available literature on resilience and resiliency theory is included. Resiliency is defined as the experience of being disrupted by change, opportunities, adversity, stressors, or challenges and, after some disorder, accessing personal gifts and character strengths to grow stronger through the disruption. Results Research in a diabetes population suggests that resiliency training in addition to standard diabetes education in people with type 2 diabetes improved coping with diabetes-related stress, having fun in life, helping others, and feeling trustworthy. Conclusions Psychosocial and physiological improvements can help people with diabetes thrive instead of succumb to despair. Interventions to foster resilience among people with type 2 diabetes have the potential to make an important contribution to reducing the risk of complications and increasing positive life outcomes. Diabetes educators using the resiliency approach in tandem with standard diabetes education programs can assist people with type 2 diabetes to become more self-directed in their diabetes care.",10,10,"Endocrinology & Metabolism; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"

Nowadays the Republic of Tatarstan is actively involved in the process of rest and recovery of children. On its territory there are suburban camps for rest and recreation; specialized profile camps for gifted children; children's health centers; health improvement camps, children's camps at sanatorium-resort organizations; camps with day stay; tent camps; labor and sports camps. The quality of children's recreation in health camps largely depends on the students' performance level. Practical training of the Kazan Federal University (KFU) students is carried out in accordance with the instructional materials of the Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation, the requirements set forth in the educational standards of higher professional education, the Regulations on the procedure for the practice of the KFU students. However, there is a problem of students-future teachers, mastering competences in the field of educational activities carried out in children's health camps. The purpose of the study is to identify, substantiate and experimentally test new approaches to the system of preparing students for educational activities in the conditions of a children's health institution. Object of the study is students' preparation for educational activities in the conditions of a children's health camp. The subject of the study is the specifics of the formation of students' readiness for educational activities in the children's health camp. The methodological basis of the research was: the theories that examine the characteristics of the professional activity of the teacher and the statements that determine the quality of the teacher's activity; the analysis of scientific research related to the peculiarities of the educational system of the children's health-improving institution and professional development of a teacher; the analysis of creative abilities and skills in the professional development of the student's personality. The research methods were: analysis of theoretical sources, generalization of innovative pedagogical experience, modeling. In the process of research, the components of the student's professional training were defined: targeted, meaningful, organization and activity, evaluative and productive. The methodological approaches (system, personal, activity, creativity, competence) are analyzed in the context of modern theories of student readiness formation for educational activities in the children's health camp.

With giftedness being primarily associated with White or Asian males, such organizational implicit theories of excellence may shape individuals' sense of belonging depending on the extent to which they match the gifted White/Asian male prototype, i.e., the prototypical gifted person which is typically imagined to be a White or Asian male. Previous research has reported fixed excellence theories emphasizing giftedness (vs. malleable theories emphasizing effort) to impair the sense of belonging of females and negatively stereotyped ethnic minorities. We investigate the combined effects of gender and ethnicity. We predicted that, while individuals whose gender and ethnicity do not match the gifted prototype show a reduced sense of belonging in fixed organizations, White/Asian males who match the gifted prototype show the opposite effect, experiencing a higher sense of belonging in fixed (vs. malleable) organizations. In an experimental study (N = 663 students), we manipulated advertising material used by a highly selective academic institution in Germany and tested effects on students' belonging. Whereas the original material emphasized giftedness as essential for excelling (fixed excellence version), our manipulated version stressed effort (malleable version). As expected, females from stereotyped ethnic minority groups felt less belonging in the fixed (vs. malleable) organization, while White/Asian males anticipated stronger belonging in the fixed (vs. malleable) organization. Fixed views of excellence impair negatively stereotyped individuals' belonging but may even strengthen the belonging of prototypical academic elites.",1,1,Psychology

USE OF STUDENT REFLECTIONS AS TOOLS TO IMPROVE TEACHING STRATEGIES,"4TH INTERNATIONAL TECHNOLOGY, EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE (INTED 2010)",student reflections; teaching strategies; classroom assessment techniques; blogs,,"A key role of the higher education instructor is to communicate enthusiasm to their students. University teaching has changed from the traditional didactic lecture to use of active learning strategies. The image of the instructor filling the empty vessel of a passive student's mind has changed. A lecture class no longer entails simply scripted delivery of information but may also include a variety of active learning technologies capable of truly engaging students. The altered needs of students have been instrumental in this change. Students now demand more for their money and are prepared to travel to get the most from their education. There is now an increased diversity within the student body. Many students enter education at an older age, perhaps having worked therefore bringing life experience to the classroom. Moreover, the classroom is increasingly multicultural. Use of learning styles in teaching has been well documented. Understanding how our students learn and what works best for them is fundamental to our individual approaches to teaching. This paper explores teaching of Molecular Biology to undergraduate Biomedical Science students using a multiple intelligences approach. Individual learning styles are considered as is how teaching style is influenced by learning styles. Lectures contain a myriad of activities including classroom dialogue and classroom assessment techniques such as mindmapping and the minute paper. Materials are posted on a VLE and the use of inclass animations are stored on the VLE for use outside the classroom. The VLE is also used to communicate with students when online and to host online chat-rooms before assessments. Weblogs were also developed. Pairs of students created blogs where inclass activities were discussed. Engagement in blogs is of interest from both a social and pedagogical perspective. A major advantage is their ability to support a sense of community within the class. Many students came alive in the blogs. Gifted students, normally reticent in the classroom, can become quite opinionated while weaker students are inspired and motivated to contribute. From a teaching perspective, insight is gained into what a student thinks/feels. We may learn about difficulties they are having with the course, identify particularly difficult areas which can inform our teaching. We may also gain insight into other difficulties in the student's life. Thus, blogs help in reflecting on teaching strategies and in identifying areas requiring adjustment. From the pedagogical perspective, blogs encourage reflective practice. By making work semi-public and transparent, students see what others are doing and this can exert positive peer pressure. When writing blogs students must consider what they want to say, thus forcing them to think about their course. Because blogging is relatively new in the education arena, it is perceived as being a fashionable alternative to reading or doing essays so it can more readily engage students. Blogging can also be done anywhere/anytime; requiring only an internet-accessible computer. In this way we can fit this extension of learning around other activities.",0,0,Education & Educational Research

We assessed the effectiveness of the mentoring program by comparing the developmental trajectories of program participants with those of three control groups: applicants who were randomly chosen for later participation (waiting-list control group) and a female and a male control group. Finally, we examined whether differences in program effectiveness could be partially explained by characteristics of the interaction with the domain. Program applicants possessed more advantageous individual characteristics but, unexpectedly, less advantageous home and school environments than female and male members of the control groups.

How do statistical regularities influence the processing of each triplet element and inserted distractors that disrupt the regularity? Given that increased attention to triplets induced by VSL and inhibition of unattended triplets, we predicted that VSL would promote memory for each triplet constituent, and degrade memory for inserted stimuli. Across the first two experiments, we found that objects from structured sequences were more likely to be remembered than objects from random sequences, and that letters (Experiment 1) or objects (Experiment 2) inserted into structured sequences were less likely to be remembered than those inserted into random sequences. In the subsequent two experiments, we examined an alternative account for our results, whereby the difference in memory for inserted items between structured and random conditions is due to individuation of items within random sequences. Our findings replicated even when control letters (Experiment 3A) or objects (Experiment 3B) were presented before or after, rather than inserted into, random sequences. Our findings suggest that statistical learning enhances memory for each item in a regular set and impairs memory for items that disrupt the regularity. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

I then introduce developmental systems approaches as a new trend in research, and explain how it reinstates the topic of talent development in developmental research, and by so doing enriches our understanding of human development. I then explore the viability of talent development research and theoretical development being guided by the developmental systems framework. Finally, I identify potential contributions of talent development research to the field of child and adolescent development.

However, in the current academic year (i.e. the second year after the new accreditation) the study results significantly worsened.

This essay examines some of the most important ethical questions surrounding biomedical enhancement in the light of the question whether such enhancement does not specifically add to the disenchantment problematic in current-day philosophy. The disenchantment of the world associated with the enlightenment onset of modernity may be viewed as the process whereby mystical or supernatural causes and solutions to practical, everyday problems came to be replaced with rational and scientific explanations and technological solutions. This intellectualisation was on the one hand viewed in a positive manner as the increasing mastery of humanity over its existence, not only in terms of the resulting eradication of disease and illness, but also in terms of the improvement of life in general. On the other hand, the intellectualisation and concomitant disenchantment of the world have been associated with negative outcomes. Technology with its resulting emphasis on material existence has, according to many, alienated humanity from other forms of experience - particularly religious experience, blunting our sense of awe and wonder at the unknown. The author posits enhancement as a striving for the improvement of our existing capacities, as being in congruence with endeavours which have long characterised human existence. Examples range from early attempts to improve and organise life, such as numeracy and literacy, through the development of institutions, up to contemporary preventative medicine such as vaccination against a host of diseases. On the other hand, this drive to improve is increasingly leading to the possibility of self-directed evolution, resulting in a radical transformation of the biological identity of the human being and even the possible creation of a new species (trans-humanism'). This latter interpretation of the possible outcomes or consequences of enhancement has elicited much debate concerning the enhancement project. Arguments against biomedical enhancement are often founded upon a distinction between treatment and enhancement, whereby the former as an intervention to restore normal functioning is deemed permissible. A noted proponent of such a stance is Norman Daniels (2009) who argues that the risks involved in the utilisation of genetic interventions in cases of serious genetic diseases are outweighed by the potential benefits, whereas the same may not hold in cases of enhancement, which can be distinguished from treatment or therapy. The author, however, points out in accordance with thinkers such as Harris (1998) and Holtug (1998), that the enhancement/treatment distinction is not tenable and collapses in the face of particular situations as evidenced by various examples he discusses. The second argument against enhancement discussed by the author is the objection that enhancement compromises the autonomy of those who are enhanced - an argument of which Habermas (2003) is the primary exponent. For Habermas, the association of enhancement with eugenics is inescapable. He views such interventions as a violation of the equality and autonomy of human beings due to their subjection to the intentions of third parties. Responses to this position are discussed, such as Buchanan's (2011) counter-argument that such a position is indicative of genetic determinism in its exclusive focus on genotype and its denial of the vastly influential role played by environmental factors in forming the identity of an individual. A third argument against enhancement discussed by the author, is put forward by Sandel (2007). Sandel regards the aim to enhance as characterised by a desire for perfection and control over the world, a denial of the giftedness of life as well as an erosion of the typical love and acceptance a parent ought to feel for its child as it is. The author argues that Sanders admonishments to appreciate the giftedness of life are evidence of a deeper objection to the perceived disenchantment of life wrought by technological change. However, objections to this argument generally draw attention to its inconsistency. Sandel regards changes achieved through genetic manipulation as a violation of the giftedness of life, but appears to have no objection to the non-genetic modes of influence and manipulation that we exert upon our offspring in an attempt to shape them to our perceived desires. The example highlighted by the author relates to the way in which we direct and shape the development of children and thus aims to improve them through education. Why, he asks, does Sandel see such aims of improvement as acceptable but not improvement through genetic interventions? Further objections to Sandel's argument are discussed, such as the implications of granting moral preference to the gifted or given state of life, as well as Sanders seemingly teleological view of evolution. The author then discusses transhumanism, a movement advocating radical enhancement which may ultimately result in the emergence of a new species that developed out of human beings. Objections to the transhumanist acceptance of such a possibility have focused on the moral imperative to keep human nature intact. Various responses to this position are discussed, one of which is Daniels' argument (2009), which views human nature as a dispositional, selective population concept. A further objection to radical enhancement is also discussed, namely concern regarding the practical implications of the creation of a highly superior transhuman species for humans who choose to remain unenhanced. Wikler (2009), for example, asks in this respect whether such a species would be justified in assuming a paternalistic attitude towards the unenhanced in the same way we make decisions regarding the well-being of children and mentally disabled people. Buchanan's response in terms of the devising of a threshold level of competence is then explained and preferred by the author The author also engages with several suggestions regarding the seeming impasse with which the enhancement debate has been characterised. As he points out, humanity has always tried to improve itself thus to oppose enhancement is in a sense to oppose the inevitable. This inevitability suggests that we should focus upon specific projects of enhancement that may be more problematic than others, rather than rejecting enhancement outright. Our guiding principles for adjudicating such projects ought to be whether or not they are to our benefit or disadvantage as a species, as well as whether or not they respect human rights, persons and human dignity. Useful work that may be used as a guide is Bostrom and Sandberg's (2009) heuristic which challenges alleged intuitions regarding the wisdom of nature. In addition, Buchanan's (2011) cautionary guidelines for future research provide valuable suggestions regarding the avoidance of cascading negative consequences. Rather than viewing biomedical enhancement as a disillusionment of the world or a blunting of our sense of mystery and awe, the author concludes that we should allow the possibilities opened up by modern science to stimulate our sense of wonder A sense of awe need not be limited solely in response to the unknown but may also arise from a disclosure of the unknown. An enchantment with the world need not be the outcome of darkness but rather an anticipation and result of discovery.",2,2,Social Issues

However, the performance of the automatic search is not always satisfactory for the search of long trails or ciphers with large state sizes. Compared with the extensive attention on the enhancement for the search with the mixed integer linear programming (MILP) method, few works care for the acceleration of the automatic search with the Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) or satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) method. This paper intends to fill this vacancy. Firstly, with the additional encoding variables of the sequential counter circuit for the original objective function in the standard SAT method, we put forward a new encoding method to convert the Matsui's bounding conditions into Boolean formulas. This approach does not rely on new auxiliary variables and significantly reduces the consumption of clauses for integrating multiple bounding conditions into one SAT problem. Then, we evaluate the accelerating effect of the novel encoding method under different sets of bounding conditions. With the observations and experience in the tests, a strategy on how to create the sets of bounding conditions that probably achieve extraordinary advances is proposed. The new idea is applied to search for optimal differential and linear characteristics for multiple ciphers. For PRESENT, GIFT-64, RECTANGLE, LBlock, TWINE, and some versions in SIMON and SPECK families of block ciphers, we obtain the complete bounds (full rounds) on the number of active S-boxes, the differential probability, as well as the linear bias. The acceleration method is also employed to speed up the search of related-key differential trails for GIFT-64. Based on the newly identified 18-round distinguisher with probability 2-58, we launch a 26-round key-recovery attack with 260.96 chosen plaintexts. To our knowledge, this is the longest attack on GIFT-64. Lastly, we note that the attack result is far from threatening the security of GIFT-64 since the designers recommended users to double the number of rounds under the related-key attack setting.",29,30,Computer Science

Third-grade students were chosen for this study because this age level is at the lower end of when many US standards documents suggest students should learn to use the Earth's rotation to explain daily celestial motion. Interviews with third-grade students (n = 24), prior to formal astronomy education, revealed that about half are working from naive mental models. The other half of the students used more scientific explanations for the Sun's apparent motion but used scientific descriptions or explanations of the Moon's and stars' daily apparent motion far less frequently. We also describe an instructional approach designed to support students as they move between the Earth-based and heliocentric frames of reference using computer simulations and modelling with hands-on and kinaesthetic strategies. This instruction was tested with another group of third-grade students as part of their gifted programme (n = 16). Pre/post-interview analysis supports the instructional approach as the students showed a more sophisticated ability to move between the Earth-based and heliocentric frames of reference. The students' high initial knowledge level, entering instruction at the more advanced end of the general third-grade student population, limits our ability to generalize the instructional findings; however, these findings provide an important step in improving our understanding of how to support students in this complex area of astronomical reasoning.",24,25,Education & Educational Research

Children who experienced one year of Montessori education demonstrated stronger pre-academic skills at the end of pre-K and, in turn, performed better on standardized assessments of math and reading in third grade than those who did not. No differences emerged in students' identification as gifted and talented nor in third-grade GPA. Taken together, these findings suggest that the benefits of one year of Montessori at age 4 may carry forward over time and to the extent that they do, these benefits are attributed to the fact that Montessori graduates entered kindergarten more ready academically. At the same time, however, the persisting benefits of Montessori were 60-70% smaller four years after program exit and were less robust than the end of pre-K outcomes.",2,2,Psychology

Most doctors, however, practice outside of academic institutions and see pharmaceutical detailers and accept drug samples and gifts. Little guidance for practicing physicians exists about transforming practices to become pharma-free. Consideration must be given to the impact on practice culture, staff views, and patient needs. Methods: A small private practice, setting out to transform into a pharma-free clinic, used a practice transformation process that examined the industry presence in the clinic, educated the doctors on potential conflicts of interest, and improved practice flow. Staff were given the opportunity to share concerns, and their issues were acknowledged. Educational interventions were developed to help providers keep current. Finally, efforts were made to educate patients about the policy. Results: The clinic recorded the degree to which it was detailed. Loss of gifts, keeping current with new drugs, and managing without samples were noted concerns. Policy change champions developed strategies to address concerns. Discussion: A shift in practice culture to a pharma-free clinic is achievable and maintainable over time. Barriers to success can be identified and overcome with attention given to careful gathering of information, staff input, and stakeholder education.",6,6,General & Internal Medicine

During COVID-19, however, over half of parents have reported mental health symptoms in their children. Specifically, depressive symptoms, anxiety, contamination obsessions, family well-being challenges, and behavioral concerns have emerged globally for children during the pandemic. Without treatment or prevention, such concerns may hinder positive development, personal life trajectory, academic success, and inhibit children from meeting their potential. A school-based resiliency program for children (DREAM) for children was developed, and the goal of this study was to collaborate with stakeholders to translate it into an online-live hybrid. Our team developed a methodology to do this based on Knowledge Translation-Integration (KTI), which incorporates stakeholder engagement throughout the entire research to action process. KTI aims to ensure that programs are acceptable, sustainable, feasible, and credible. Through collaboration with parents and school board members, qualitative themes of concerns, recommendations and validation were established, aiding in meaningful online-live translation. Even though the original program was developed for intellectually gifted children, who are at greater risk for mental health concerns, stakeholders suggested using the program for both gifted and non-gifted children, given the universal applicability of the tools, particularly during this pandemic time period when mental health promotion is most relevant. An online-live approach would allow students studying at home and those studying in the classroom to participate in the program. Broader implications of this study include critical recommendations for the development of both online-live school programs in general, as well as social-emotional literacy programs for children.",2,2,Psychology

The modified version of FSMAS was administered to 9(th)-12(th) grade students at a gifted boarding high school in Istanbul, Turkey. The FSMAS instrument was highly reliable (Cronbach-alpha, from .942 to .777). The factor analysis showed that there were eight different thematic categories among the items. Overall, findings indicated that students had positive attitudes towards the use of technology for learning, regardless of their various personal characteristics such as gender, age, grade level, previous experience, and content area of interest. In addition, students at lower grades tended to have more satisfaction in using technology compared to the higher graders. Interestingly, more experienced students were less confident in using technology compared to less experienced students. Although female students did not have a negative attitude towards the use computers for learning, they felt less confident in using technology compared to male students. Finally, students good at science and mathematics were more positive about their ability to use technology as compared to their social science counterparts.",10,10,Education & Educational Research

The rationale for this is the Confucian stress on xiao (filial piety), whereby individuals' bodies are to be intact at death. In the view of many, the result is a prohibition on the donation of bodies to anatomy departments for the purpose of dissection. The role of dissection throughout the development of anatomy within a Confucian context is traced, and in contemporary China the establishment of donation programs and the appearance of memorial monuments is noted. In reassessing Confucian attitudes, the stress laid on a particular interpretation of filial piety is questioned, and an attempt is made to balance this with the Confucian emphasis on a moral duty to those outside one's immediate family. The authors argue that the fundamental Confucian norm ren (humaneness or benevolence) allows for body donation as people have a moral duty to help others. Moreover, the other central Confucian value, li (rites), offers important insights on how body donation should be performed as a communal activity, particularly the necessity of developing ethically and culturally appropriate rituals for body donation. In seeking to learn from this from a Western perspective, it is contended that in all societies the voluntary donation of bodies is a deeply human activity that is to reflect the characteristics of the community within which it takes place. This is in large part because it has educational and personal repercussions for students. Anat Sci Educ 11: 525-531.

Books in the main library and faculty libraries became so outdated that they were unable to support current academic work. The Library was not able to subscribe to core periodicals and journals. In 1987, the PNDC government, with the help of the World Bank, instituted a policy to replace scientific equipment and to supply books and journals to higher education institutions. Under the Educational Sector Adjustment Programme (EDSAC), academic libraries in the country received books, journals, and equipment including photocopiers, microfilm/microfiche readers and cameras, and telex machines. In 1991, the PNDC Deputy Secretary for Education invited the three university libraries to review the procedures for procuring journals for tertiary institutions in view of difficulties which had been encountered in previous years. Besides materials received under the EDSAC programme, the UST library receives gifts and donations from recognized international agencies. Some of the gifts create problems when materials donated do not cover subject areas of interest to the library. The library also exchanges publications with other institutions as a means of acquiring useful items. The university's calendar and prospectus are the main publications used for the purpose. The Newspaper Registration of Ghana Act, 1963, urges publishers to deposit copies of books published in the country at the UST Library among five others. The majority of publishers flagrantly refuse to do so because the sanctions against defaulters are rarely enforced. The library also receives budgetary allocations, though not enough to purchase books locally. (C) 1995 Academic Press Limited.",0,0,Information Science & Library Science

Red and white muscle tissues were collected at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6 and 12 h after the glucose tolerance test (GTT) or saline injection, and the time course of changes in molecular and metabolic adaption of glucose metabolism of these two tissues were evaluated. The results showed that the expression of insulin-responsive glucose transporter 4 (glut4) was up-regulated at 4 h after the GTT in the red muscle, implying an increase of glucose uptake. However, the expression of glut4 in the white muscle did not change with glucose load. The glycolysis of red muscle in tilapia was stimulated during 2-4 h after the GTE, as the expression of hexokinase 1b (hk1b), hk2, phosphofructokinase muscle type a (pfkma) and pfkmb and the activity of HK and PFK increased. By contrast, only the expression of hklb was up-regulated at 6 h after the GTE in the white muscle. The mRNA level of glycogen synthase 1 (gys1) and glycogen content increased at 2 and 6 h, respectively after the GTT in the red muscle, suggesting that glucose storage was provoked. However, glycogen content in the white muscle was not impacted by GTE. Lipogenesis was stimulated in the red muscle as reflected by up-regulated expression of acetyl-CoA carboxylase alpha (acc alpha) (during 2-4 h) and acc beta (during 4-12 h) with GET. In the white muscle, however, the expression of acca was not changed, and mRNA level of acc beta was not up regulated until 6 h after the GTT. Taken together, it was concluded that the glycolytic and glycogen synthesis mechanisms in the red muscle were highly regulated by an acute glucose load while those in the white muscle were less responsive to this stimulus.",5,5,Endocrinology & Metabolism; Zoology

The participants included 835 fourth-grade students and 416 11th-grade students from four elementary schools and one high school in the United States. Students in treatment groups were asked to write three letters for exchange at the beginning/during/completion of an 8-week teaching unit about force and motion. The structure of writing was based on three components of arguments: question, claim, and evidence. A comparison of the pre- and posttest results indicated that students who engaged in collaborative letter-writing tasks performed better than students who did not. The pre- and posttest results also showed that female, special, low socioeconomic status, and gifted students benefited the most from the collaborative letter-writing tasks. Through the letter-writing exchange activities, the fourth-grade students were supported and encouraged to learn difficult concepts by the 11th-grade students. The more the 11th graders asked the fourth graders for explanation and clarification of the concepts in the letters, the more the fourth-grade students learned. Two factors related to argumentative writing were identified as predictors of success on students' achievement tests: overall cohesiveness, with an emphasis on embedding multiple modal representations in the text and the strength of the relationship between claims and evidence. This study suggests that there is a pedagogical need to build support structures to help students understand the role of audience, the function of multiple modal representations, and the quality of evidence for supporting knowledge claims in argumentative writing, as this could lead to a better understanding of scientific concepts.

OBJECTIVE To estimate the association between gestational age and 4 outcomes in school-aged children: readiness to enter kindergarten, scores on standardized tests in elementary and middle school, gifted status, and low performance. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In a retrospective cohort study, children born in Florida between 1992 and 2002 at 23 to 41 weeks' gestation who entered Florida's public schools between 1995 and 2012 were assessed for kindergarten readiness and tested in mathematics and reading in grades 3 through 8. Data analysis was performed from January 12, 2016, to March 1, 2017. EXPOSURES Gestational age at birth. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Kindergarten readiness, scores on the Florida Comprehensive Achievement Test (FCAT), classified as gifted, and classified as low performance. RESULTS A total of 1 527 113 singleton infants with gestational ages of 23 to 41 weeks born between 1992 and 2002 were matched to Florida public school records. Of these, 1 301 497 children were included in the analysis; 641 479 (49.3%) were girls. A total of 301 (65.0%) Florida children born at 23 to 24 weeks' gestation were designated as ready to start kindergarten. When the FCAT test scores were adjusted for potentially confounding maternal and infant variables, children born at 23 to 24 weeks' gestation performed 0.66 SD (95% CI, -0.73 to -0.59) lower compared with those born at full term. A total of 123 554 (9.5%) of all Florida-born public school students were considered gifted, including 17 (1.8%) of those born at 23 to 24 weeks' gestation. In comparison, 75 458 (5.8%) of all Florida-born public school students were low performing; 310 (33.5%) of these children had been born at 23 to 24 weeks' gestation. Kindergarten readiness, FCAT scores, and gifted status were positively related to gestational age, whereas low performance was inversely related to gestational age.

There has been very little change in the proportion of left-handers since the Upper Paleolithic Age about 10,000 years ago and it is estimated to be around 10%. As the history of human thinking has developed from superstition to science, the explanation of left-handedness transformed from devil's workto neurological specificity.This paper presents this very interesting historical change by analyzing the data on left-handedness and the attitudes towards it in human societies from prehistory to today. Even in a relatively open-minded society, parents and teachers may encourage a left-handed child to switch to right-handedness to make their lives easier in a largely right-handed world. On the other hand, left-handedness is increasingly seen as a special gift, and left-handed people have started to favor themselves as more competent in relation to the right-handed people.",3,3,General & Internal Medicine

Here, we apply the theory to the domain of talent development, by reviewing short-termand long-term cognitive interventions. We argue that macro-level analyses of cultural practices (e.g., matrilineal inheritance and property ownership) and national systems of education are consistent with the bioecological theory; when the findings from these analyses are unpacked, the engines that drive them are so-called proximal processes. This finding has implications for the design and delivery of instruction and the development of talent. We argue that talent is fostered by the same three bioecological mechanisms that explain the actualization of genetic potential. We conclude by discussing several self-descriptions and personal narratives by gifted students in which they spontaneously refer to these bioecological mechanisms in their own talent-development processes. Similar testimonials have been documented by historic talent researchers such as Benjamin Bloom, noting the importance of continual adjustments in feedback.",1,1,Psychology

Aims: The purpose of this study was to examine associations between maternal verbal scaffolding, Verbal IQ (VIQ) and executive function measures in preschoolers born VLBW. Subjects: A total of 64 VLBW and 40 NBW preschoolers ranging in age from 3 1/2 to 4 years participated in the study. Outcome measures: VIQ was measured with the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence Third Edition. Executive function tests included the Bear Dragon, Gift Delay Peek, Reverse Categorization and Dimensional Change Card Sort-Separated Dimensions. Study design: Maternal verbal scaffolding was coded during a videotaped play session. Associations between maternal verbal scaffolding and preschoolers' measures of VIQ and executive function were compared. Covariates included test age, maternal education, and gender. Results: Preschoolers born VLBW performed significantly worse on VIQ and all executive function measures compared to those born NBW. Maternal verbal scaffolding was associated with VIQ for VLBW preschoolers and Gift Delay Peek for the NBW group. Girls born VLBW outperformed boys born VLBW on VIQ and Bear Dragon.

For this reason, problem-solving skills take an important place among mathematical skills. Mathematics (NCTM) standards also indicate that problem-solving skills have higher priority in teaching mathematics. One of the mathematical disciplines which has great application for solving of the real problems is the graph theory. Graph theory as a part of mathematics has the potential to become a popular tool for teaching and learning mathematics in elementary and secondary school for solving and understanding of many logical puzzles. This kind of puzzles are very complicated and present complex problems for understanding by the students at elementary and secondary level. But, by using the basic concept of graph theory the students can easily make visualization of such kind of problems and can easily prepare for different kind of mathematical competitions. The graph theory can facilitate the learning process, because it provides good illustrations by which the applications of the ideas can be shown and presented to the children. In this paper we are considering a methodology that improve the students' ability for logical thinking For that purpose, we will consider some kind of logical mathematical problems which are usually given at the mathematical classes but especially for gifted and talented students.",0,0,Education & Educational Research; Engineering

This work indicated the method to synthesize a green material, which could remove contaminants to protect the natural environment. The porosity and functionality effects of amine-functionalized activated carbon (AFAC) enhanced the removal of toxic heavy metals (THMs) in aqueous solution. The raw activated carbon (RAC) was thermally modified with ultrahigh pure nitrogen (UHPN) at 500 degrees C and 1000 degrees C and then amine-functionalized with coupling agent of aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APS). They were denoted as AFAC-5 and AFAC-10, respectively. The data showed an enhanced metal adsorption capacity of the AFACs, because the modification produced more desired porosity and increased amine functional groups. AFAC-10, modified at a higher temperature, showed much higher THM adsorption capacity than AFAC-5, modified at a lower temperature, and RAC. The adsorption capacity decreased in the following order: Ni > Cd > Zn, which was in good agreement with the increasing electronegativity and ionic potential and the decreasing atomic radius. The maximum THM adsorption capacity of AFAC-10 for Ni, Cd, and Zn was 242.5, 226.9, and 204.3 mg/g, respectively.",13,14,Chemistry

After observing historical characteristics of donors, college officials have a greater probability of accurately predicting future alumni gifts. Key determinants of alumni giving for both consistent and occasional donors are as follows: volunteering for the college, major in a social science division, language school attendance, residence in states with alumni chapters, and employment within the financial sector. Additionally, alumni with relatives who have attended the college, and alumni who have played a varsity sport during college, are two groups very likely to donate. Our study suggests that Alumni Offices may benefit from rating donors' giving potential (and subsequently focusing on these individuals), extensively publicizing reunions, and by targeting those who volunteered during their college years. Among occasional donors, Alumni Offices may want to target males, fraternity/sorority members, and alumni who are close to retirement. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

This study used focus groups to explore how potential and actual participants of biobanks in the UK and Germany negotiate the relationship between concerns over privacy protection, reciprocity and benefit sharing. In Germany, 15 focus groups (n = 151) were conducted: 11 general public groups (n = 116) and 4 with former cohort study participants including the KORA and the Popgen cohort study (n = 35). In the UK, 9 focus groups (n = 61) were conducted: 4 general public groups (n = 33) and 5 with UK Biobank and European Huntington's Disease (Euro-HD) Registry biorepository participants (n = 28). Forms of reciprocity were found to partially mitigate potential and actual biobank participants' concerns over personal privacy risks and future unintended consequences of biobank in both Germany and the UK. Specifically, notions of individual reciprocity were at the forefront in the context of personal disadvantages to participation, while communal reciprocity was prominent when potential and actual participants were discussing the uncertainty of the long-term nature of biobanking. The research indicates that reciprocity can be viewed as a mode to deal with individuals' concerns about participating in a biobank, both by acting as a return 'favor' or 'gift,' and through establishing an ongoing relationship between participants, researchers and society. It is suggested that future biobanking projects will need to flexibly combine individual and communal forms of reciprocity if they are to recruit and maintain sufficient numbers of participants.

Despite research on children's lie telling, there is little known about the spectrum of concealment methods that children use, which can range from full disclosures to active concealment through the use of deception. This study focused on children's use of concealment methods in a prosocial situation, in relation to their cognitive ability. Children aged 4-11 years (N = 106) completed several cognitive activities that measured theory of mind (ToM), working memory, and inhibitory control with an experimenter and created a surprise gift for a parent. After the activities were complete, children were told to keep the surprise gift a secret until it was ready, then they were sent back to their parents, who questioned them about their activities. Children were coded based on their concealment behavior (full disclosers, partial concealers, passive concealers, and active concealers) in response to their parents' questions. A discriminant function analysis indicated that age and children's cognitive scores (first-order ToM, second-order ToM, and working memory) differentiated between children who disclosed the secret about the surprise gift and children who used partial-to-active concealment methods to keep the secret. Results suggest that younger children, and children with lower ToM and working memory were more likely to disclose the secret. Findings suggest that children employ various methods of concealment to keep a prosocial secret from a parent and that higher cognitive ability is associated with the tendency to use concealment methods in social interactions.",11,11,Psychology

In this paper, we shed new light on girls' underrepresentation through a post-structural feminist investigation of mathematics teachers' discursive constructions of high-level senior secondary mathematics students. Our analysis of semi-structured interviews with 22 Australian mathematics teachers revealed gendered views that serve to exclude many students from the high-level mathematics student category. Most concerning was their recurring naturalised construction of successful high-level mathematics students as endowed with the right, invariably male, brain. In so doing, teachers repeatedly closed off the possibility of success to those lacking such a 'mathematics gift', effectively 'counting girls out'. We argue that increasing girls' participation in mathematics requires moving beyond current efforts to raise female interest and confidence to, more profoundly, disrupt enduring discourses of male superiority in mathematics.",10,10,Education & Educational Research

Chinese, Japanese, and American preschoolers' (N = 150) displays of emotion to an undesired gift were coded across both social and nonsocial contexts in a disappointing gift paradigm. Generalized estimating equations revealed that, regardless of culture, when children received a disappointing gift, they showed more positive expressions of emotion (fake smile) in social contexts (in the presence of unfamiliar and familiar examiners) relative to when they were alone, suggesting that preschool-aged children are able to mask their disappointment with positive displays. However, children's emotion expressions varied across both cultures and contexts. American children were more positively and negatively expressive than Japanese children and were more negatively expressive than Chinese children. Chinese and Japanese preschoolers verbally reported more negative emotions but showed more neutral expressions than American preschoolers when receiving the disappointing gift. In addition, across different contexts of the task, there were subtle differences in how Chinese and Japanese children regulated their emotional expressions, with Chinese children showing similar levels of neutral expressions (e.g., poker face) across different contexts in the task. Thus, our findings highlight the importance of understanding cultural meanings and practices underlying emotion development during early childhood. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

More than 75% of respondents would support legislation banning tobacco advertising in all public places, and 88% would support legislation prohibiting smoking in all public places. Multivariate analyses indicated that those who were female, more than 50 years, have accepted college and above education, and perceived greater benefits to smoking cessation were more likely to support banning tobacco advertising and prohibiting smoking in public places.

The aim of our study was to establish the current scale and type of informal payments, as well as public attitudes towards these payments. Methods: A nationally representative survey of 1003 individuals was conducted in Bulgaria in July 2010 using face-to-face interviews based on a standardized questionnaire. Respondents were selected through a multi-stage random probability method. The questionnaire included questions on total informal payments (in cash and in kind) for health services used by the respondent during the preceding 12 months. Results: About 13% of users reported informal payments for outpatient visits and 33% of users reported to have paid informally for hospitalizations. The average amount paid informally for inpatient services was nearly twice higher than that for outpatient services. More than 50% of the sample had negative attitudes towards informal payments in both cash and kind, but about 27% of respondents had a positive attitude towards giving gifts in kind. Regression analysis showed that respondents with higher levels of education had more negative attitudes towards informal cash payments. Positive attitudes towards gifts in kind were more often stated by citizens of larger cities. Conclusion: Informal payments continue to exist in Bulgaria irrespective of the formal co-payments introduced in 2000.

For exploring ways to support student-generated drawing, we focused on the perspective of 'Norms' - shared behaviour patterns desirable in a community. We investigated what norms were formed and how they emerged when students made drawings to explain phenomena. Data were collected from classroom observations, interviews and students' artefacts from five physics lessons in a primary school gifted programme. The data were analysed based on three essential features of norms: justifiability, sharing and behaviours. Consequently, two main norms were reported with four sub-norms in terms of two processes of drawing: meaning-making and representing. First, to show invisible mechanism, 'explaining why' was emphasised as a main norm of the meaning-making process. This norm was shared in classroom discussions and drawings by interacting with two sub-norms that supported students to interpret phenomena with 'key concepts' at a 'particle level'. Second, 'telling a story visually' was another main norm of the representing process. This norm was formed with two sub-norms that encouraged students to visualise ideas with 'their own symbols' in ways that were 'easy to understand'. These results indicate that norms can guide desirable directions for students to construct and visualise ideas.",2,2,Education & Educational Research

In accordance with Entropy's distinctive name and research area, this paper creatively provides a bibliometric analysis method to not only look back at the vicissitude of the entire entropy topic, but also witness the journal's growth and influence during this process. Based on 123,063 records extracted from the Web of Science, the work in sequence analyzes publication outputs, high-cited literature, and reference co-citation networks, in the aspects of the topic and the journal, respectively. The results indicate that the topic now has become a tremendous research domain and is still roaring ahead with great potentiality, widely researched by different kinds of disciplines. The most significant hotspots so far are suggested as the theoretical or practical innovation of graph entropy, permutation entropy, and pseudo-additive entropy. Furthermore, with the rapid growth in recent years, Entropy has attracted many dominant authors of the topic and experiences a distinctive geographical publication distribution. More importantly, in the midst of the topic, the journal has made enormous contributions to major research areas, particularly being a spear head in the studies of multiscale entropy and permutation entropy.",11,13,Physics

The definition of technology in relation to the teaching of literature would go beyond the machine-tool definition and into the hermeneutic sciences, which say that the message of the literary text lies above the lexical and syntactic levels in the creative unconscious of the gifted individuals. The transfer of the message has not been successfully achieved even with the combination of different media. Literary texts create an overall impression with the help of pieces of information, and hypertext seems to promise a medium for providing explanations which would help convey the 'essence' of the texts.",1,1,Information Science & Library Science

We also address coping behavior and communication about PRP between young musicians, teachers, parents, and other people, such as friends. The aim is to provide information on PRP among high-performing musicians in childhood and adolescence, which can serve as a basis for music education, practice, and prevention in the context of instrumental teaching and musicians' health. The study is part of a large-scale study (N = 1,143) with highly musically gifted participants (age 9-24 years; M = 15.1; SD = 2.14, female = 62%) at the national level of the Jugend musiziert (youth making music) contest. For data analyses, we used descriptive statistics, correlations, Chi(2)-tests, principal component analysis, Kruskal-Wallis H tests, and multivariate regression. About three-quarters (76%) of the surveyed participants stated that they had experienced pain during or after playing their instrument. Female musicians were significantly more frequently affected (79%) than male musicians (71%). With increasing age, the prevalence of PRP rises from 71 percent (9-13 years) to 85 percent (18-24 years). Regarding localization of pain, results are in line with many other studies with musculoskeletal problems the most common. Furthermore, data show a clear relationship between the duration of practice and the prevalence of PRP. Our study found averages of 7:18 h/week, whereas mean values of the duration of practice vary considerably between different instruments. The variance in practice duration is very large within the different instruments. Thus, when researching PRP, it is necessary to consider both the differences between different groups of instruments in the average duration of practice as well as the very large inter-individual variation in the duration of practice within a given instrument group. While just over half of the young musicians (56%) felt they had been taken seriously, 32 percent felt that their complaints were not completely taken seriously, and 12 percent did not feel taken seriously at all. Therefore, it is necessary to improve communication and information about PRP to prevent PRP and counteract existing complaints.",7,7,Psychology

In fact, enrollment growth can have an adverse impact on the institution's financial condition. even in the presence of excess capacity. The reason for this surprising conclusion is that the size of the subsidy required to attract additional students may cause the net financial impact to be negative. In the past two decades, private institutions have been very aggressive in their competition for gifted students. Administrators and their governing boards should carefully review their tuition discounting policies, since conventional wisdom may be misleading. This paper contains a theoretical discussion of tuition discounting policies and it explores how the marginal benefit, net of the marginal cost of increased enrollment, varies across public/private institutions and across institutions with different missions.

In order to offer solutions for enhancing the enrollment and retention of women in these areas of education and profession, the authors collected and analyzed the life history narratives of a sample group (n=12) of international women, all STEM graduates, who work in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Even if the group was small, four typologies were identified among participants' career decisions to abandon/persist in STEM: STEM career Non-starters; STEM Early career Abandoners; STEM Mid career Abandoners; STEM career Persisters. Potentially all participants had the capacity to be STEM professionals, as they had graduated in those disciplines, and more than half (58%) of these participants did continue into a STEM career. Subsequently, the majority (83%) then chose to abandon STEM, and only two (17%) of these STEM women graduates persisted with their careers in STEM professions. The theory of 'Calling' influencing the career choices of these women graduates was also investigated. There were four emergent themes of calling found from the content analysis of the life narrative data. The themes were: Theme 1 - Gift of intellect; Theme 2 - Belief in a faith; Theme 3 - Shared community (culture/family); Theme 4 - Meaning of work The findings of this study suggest that the business of STEM does little to stimulate the notion of calling to STEM careers for women, resulting in non-adoption of a STEM career and early/mid STEM career abandonment. The authors suggest that to enhance the enrollment and the retention of women in STEM sectors, new educational methodologies in the classrooms should be complemented with information from career advisors on the meaning of work in STEM, i.e. socially impactful, collaboration with others, and focus on people and things. Also careers days, networking events, conferences should be organized and attended by students and their families, with the aim to spread knowledge about the life and accomplishments of STEM women graduates.",0,0,Education & Educational Research

Their male genitalia are peculiar for an extremely elongated penisfilum, a pair of well-developed epandrial lobes (9th tergum), and a pair of degenerated gonostyli. However, the co-evolution of their face-to-face copulation behavior and the male genitalia has rarely been studied hitherto. In this paper the mating behavior of the hangingfly Bittacus planus Cheng, 1949 was observed under laboratory conditions, and the morphology of the male and female external genitalia was investigated using light and scanning electron microscopy. The male provides an insect prey as a nuptial gift to the female in courtship and mating process, and commits a face-to-face copulation. During copulation, the male abdomen twists temporarily about 180 degrees to accommodate their face-to-face mating position. The aedeagal complex has an extremely elongated penisfilum, corresponding to the elongated spermathecal duct of the female. The well-developed epandrial lobes serve as claspers to grasp the female subgenital plate during copulation, replacing the function of gonostyli, which are greatly reduced in Bittacidae. The modified proctiger assists the penisfilum to stretch and to enter into the female spermathecal duct.

Specifically, the Geometry Independent Field approximaTion (GIFT) method is applied to discretize the spatial domain, and time discretization is proceeded by Newmark method. In the framework of GIFT/Newmark, three kinds of space-time adaptivity strategies based on hierarchical a posteriori error estimations are developed successively, that is, Unidirectional Multi-level Space-Time Adaptive GIFT/Newmark (UM-STAGN), Energy-based Space-Time Adaptive GIFT/Newmark (E-STAGN), and Goal-oriented Space-Time Adaptive GIFT/ Newmark (G-STAGN) methods respectively. The main concept of UM-STAGN approach is to get rid of the elements where the error estimators reach the prescribed accuracy at each adaptation step, and then assemble the rest elements as the new subsystems to be solved at the next stage. By reducing the scale of the computational domains gradually, this method achieves efficiency to some degree, though, since it fails to transfer the error information across subsystems, the error of Quantity of Interest (QoI) cannot arrive at an expected precision. For this reason, we introduce E-STAGN methodology, wherein the error indicator of each element is reassessed at every adaptive cycle through solving the whole system again. In this case, the QoI error is able to be convergent to an acceptable accuracy. Nevertheless, as the error is accumulated with time in the time-domain problem, E-STAGN method based on the energy-norm error estimation is unable to expose the source of the error so that it fails to offer an efficient refinement. This is the motivation to establish the G-STAGN technique, where the error estimation drives from our proposed first-order Dual Weight Residual (DWR) method. G-STAGN strategy can detect the origin of QoI error, and hence it leads to a remarkably economical refinement. Numerical examples are carried out in both single-patch and multi-patch structures. It is demonstrated that both UM-STAGN and E-STAGN methods can catch the propagation of stress wave for the primal problem, while G-STAGN technique is capable to track the travel path of dual stress. Therefore, the G-STAGN strategy achieves an optimal convergent rate, compared to that obtained by UM-STAGN, E-STAGN and uniform space-time h-refinement approaches.(c) 2022 Published by Elsevier B.V.",3,3,Engineering; Mathematics; Mechanics

The World Health Organization (WHO) reported that eating unsafe substances can cause more than 200 diseases, including diarrhea and serious illnesses, such as cancer. Therefore, acquiring the necessary food safety literacy to distinguish between food safety and nutrition is a crucial competency to improve personal health. The Literacy Information and Communication System conducted a health literacy workshop in 2011, involving approximately 1,600 national and international public health and medical experts; it recommended establishing a hypothetical relationship between knowledge, attitudes, and behavior to create a new set of measurement methods for food safety literacy (Pleasant et al., 2011). Thus, integrating knowledge, attitude, and behavior is crucial in order to assess food security literacy in the 21st century (Frewer et al., 2013; Jevsnik et al., 2008; Rollin et al., 2011; Yeung & Morris, 2001). In recent years, there has been an international emphasis on literacy assessment, such as the Programme International Student Assessment, which was supported by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in 2013, using contextual-based tests to assess whether students can apply knowledge and analyze and solve problems in everyday life. First, this study aimed to develop effective food safety literacy tests, food security attitude scales, and food safety behavior scales. Second, we explored the effect of Evidence-Informed Practice (EIP) in teaching interventions on junior high school students' food safety literacy. During our pilot study, we randomly selected 467 ninth-graders from southern Taiwan to respond to research instruments regarding food safety literacy, food security attitudes, and food safety behaviors. We used the content validity index (Lawshe, 1975), item analysis, and KR 20 to examine the tests' validity, discrimination, reliability, respectively, and applied item response theory to determine a suitable model of the relationship between the tests and participants. We found that all the tests met the index of validity and reliability. Then, we conducted a quasi-experimental study design and selected 104 ninth-graders from a public junior high school in Kaohsiung City through convenience sampling; the school is known for its moral education, encouraging teachers to develop innovative teaching. This study lasted six weeks and included two teachers with similar teaching experiences who implemented different teaching styles. Both teachers had majored in health education and had 17 years of teaching experience. Teacher A was the first author of this article, graduated from the Department of Science and Education of Southern Normal University, taught two classes of students in the experimental group. The teacher B, who graduated from the Department of Health Promotion and Health Education of the Northern Normal University, was familiar with health education theory, and taught two classes of students in the comparison group. To ensure a high response rate, the first investigator informed the students of this study's purpose and research tools, mentioning that the contents of the questionnaire would be properly preserved and not be used for individual comparison. Students agreed to participate in the study and responded to two scales and a food safety literacy test that took approximately 15-20 minutes, after which they were given a small gift. Four classes participated in this study, two of which comprised the comparison group that received traditional narrative teaching; the teaching content and time were the same for this group. The other two classes in the experimental group received an EIP teaching intervention. The experimental group students ( n = 53) participated in a 6-week one period of EIP teaching model; with the same teaching intervention time, the comparison group students ( n = 51) received a teacher-centered intervention concerning new trends in dietary consumption; the intervention convened 45 minutes per week for 6 consecutive weeks. The EIP intervention involved students asking questions, thinking, gathering evidence, and making judgments. The teacher in this group questioned students to promote their thinking, enabling them to search for empirical information to support the discussion and interpretation of food security issues, such as false advertising, supplementing them with new scientific findings. Meanwhile, the comparison group was taught about food security issues in a traditional manner, with the teacher presenting and students listening. We conducted descriptive statistics, independent t-tests, and paired sample t-tests to compare the students' similarities and differences on their food safety literacy tests, food security attitude scales, and food safety behavior scales after the interventions. In addition, we used a one-way analysis of covariance to examine the effects of the EIP intervention. The results revealed that junior high school students' beliefs concerning maintaining healthy behaviors involved medium and high scores. They believed that a balanced diet, regular exercise, and good hygiene could increase the body's resistance to disease. More than 80% of the students consumed healthy food, and nearly 40% of these students consumed more than two types of healthy food. Students with a higher belief in the value of maintaining health had a significantly higher score in food safety literacy. However, those students with a frequent intake of healthy food tended to have lower scores on their food safety literacy. This study developed and validated well-structured food safety literacy scales and an effective EIP teaching model that enhanced the experimental group students' food safety literacy. This empirical evidence provides fresh insight into how to promote junior high school students' food safety literacy. Our findings have implications for implementing the EIP teaching model and administering effective food safety literacy scales with context-based items in more educational settings.",0,0,Education & Educational Research

The analyses included all references from several databases (Web of Science, ProQuest, Elsevier, Google Scholar, and bibliographies of related articles) from 1998 to 2019 that implemented the successful intelligence training program in a variety of ways. Possible moderators, selection criteria, subject areas, and grade levels were investigated. A total of 24 studies (19 articles) were included in the meta-analysis. The results revealed that successful intelligence training has a positive effect on students' overall achievement, g = 0.63, SE = 0.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.41, 0.85], k = 24, z = 5.98, p < .001, under a random-effect model. After adjusting for publication bias, the effect size (ES) g was 0.35, SE = 0.12, 95% CI [0.10, 0.60]. The ES was the largest for socioemotional outcomes, followed by triarchic outcomes and then achievement outcomes. High-IQ-based selected participants received higher ES than teacher-selected participants. Regarding subject areas, science and general triarchic training differed significantly. Among the grade levels, high-school level and primary level differed significantly. Moreover, intervention duration negatively moderated the ES significantly. Gender did not moderate the ES. All student participants benefited from the successful intelligence training program, and this benefit was greater for gifted and older students. This finding suggests that TSI training educators provide a more detailed, structured, and authentic problem situation to be more effective instead of academic problems.",1,1,Psychology

Following the main line of this idea, Buddha has made two important discoveries. The first is the discovery of the subconscious entity called papanca, a subjacent but influential concomitant of all kinds of human mental phenomena and, at the same time, the cause of all of our miseries. The second discovery is the fact that, to eliminate the papanca, it is necessary to practice the solitary and meditative life of a mendicant without any possession. Our consciousness cannot be changed, at least as far its foundations are concerned, by rational inference but only through such actions as solitary life with introspection into the nature of our consciousness. His claim that only such a solitary meditative mendicant could give people good advice on life would be most suggestive. Good advice (i.e. the most precious gift) could only be given by a person of profound wisdom as well as of total altruism, who realizes himself as such a personality through introspection into the nature of consciousness and a solitary life of no possession. These two processes should be the main components of forming the wise and altruistic person. Buddha's instruction was addressed neither to the general public nor to monks living in a community (sangha, which did not seem to exist at his time) but to his small number of disciples. His scheme for forming in a society a small number of generalists of noble character should be the subject of more serious examination for the human and social sciences of today. In addition, the proposal of Buddha to carry on praxis for the change of cognitive foundation may suggest that the objectivist stance of scientists puts them in fetters, preventing them from engaging themselves in praxis to ensure the objectivity of observation, and restricting them to their sphere of cognition.",1,1,Information Science & Library Science; Social Sciences - Other Topics

Younger mothers are less likely than older mothers to exclusively breastfeed or to exclusively breastfeed for a long duration. This systematic review explores interventions to increase the rate of exclusive breastfeeding among young mothers in high-income countries. Methods A systematic search of the following databases was completed in August 2020: CINAHL, PubMed, MEDLINE, ProQuest, PsychInfo, Web of Science, Cochrane, Scopus and Embase. A manual search of the reference lists of all the included studies and published systematic reviews was also performed. The Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias Tool was used to assess the quality of the included studies. A random effects model meta-analyses was applied. Heterogeneity of outcomes between the studies was assessed using both the chi(2) test and the I-2 statistic. Results Of 955 records identified in the search, 392 duplicates were removed, and nine studies met the inclusion criteria. Seven studies were randomised controlled trial (RCTs) and two were quasi-experimental in design. Eight were conducted in the United States. The interventions included peer counselling, telephone support, massage, gift packs, financial incentive and antenatal education. Most studies included a combination of strategies, peer counselling being the most common. A meta-analysis of four of nine included studies did not detect a difference in rate of exclusive breastfeeding to 3 months postpartum (RR 1.44; 95% CI 0.82, 2.55; p = 0.204). This review is limited by the relatively few studies which met the inclusion criteria and the small sample sizes of most included studies. High rates of attrition and formula supplementation among the participants made it difficult to detect a statistically significant effect. Consistency in follow up times would enable more studies to be included in a meta-analysis. Conclusions Peer counselling was the most promising strategy associated with higher rates of exclusive breastfeeding. However, further studies are needed to understand the breastfeeding experiences of young mothers. Young mothers should be targeted specifically in intervention studies.",15,15,Obstetrics & Gynecology; Pediatrics

Using TG-8 extract and its essential ingredients, maltotriose (MT) and 1,2-dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (PC), we investigated the perception of the secretion by gustatory sensilla in both sexes. Female-biased chemosensitivity was found in the feeding responses to the TG-8 extract. The TG-8 extract induced specific impulses in four functionally different receptor cells: the sugar, salt and other two types of receptor cells in a single gustatory sensillum on the paraglossae in both sexes. The impulse frequencies of the sugar receptor cell and a receptor cell of unknown type were significantly higher in females than those in males. There were no sexual differences in the behavioral and electrophysiological responses to MT alone; no responses were elicited by PC. However, a mixture of MT and PC elicited the behavioral responses more strongly than MT in females. The impulse frequency of sugar receptor cells toward the mixture of MT and PC also increased in females but not in males. These results suggest that the synergistic effect of PC on 'sweetness' of MT in the female cockroach contributes to her compulsive nuptial feeding. The female-biased gustatory sensitivity seems to ensure successful coupling during the nuptial feeding. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",15,15,Entomology; Physiology; Zoology

Perplexingly, when live-stream viewership itself is free, viewers voluntarily spend money to buy virtual gifts and send them to their preferred streamers. The present study aimed to examine the motivational mechanism underlying these voluntary tipping behaviors from the perspectives of materialism and self-enhancement. By a representative online survey (N = 1224), we found that participants' materialist beliefs were positively associated with both the likelihood and the amount of online tipping, and the self-enhancement motive could significantly mediate this association; furthermore, streamer endorsement could moderate the link between the self-enhancement motive and tipping amount. These findings suggest that materialist beliefs and downstream self-related motivations are among the main driving forces for online tipping. The present results extended previous research on materialism by testing its effects in a newly emerging online consumer behavior and providing direct evidence for the moderation role of the symbolic-ness of materialist behaviors. Practical implications for live-streaming platforms, educators and policymakers, such as introducing tipping amount caps, were also discussed.",11,11,Business & Economics

S. family medicine residencies permit industry to have with medical students and residents. Method In 2008, the authors e-mailed a four-question survey to residency directors or coordinators at all 460 accredited U. S. family medicine residencies concerning the types of industry support and interaction permitted. The authors conducted quantitative and qualitative analyses of survey responses and written comments. Residencies that did not permit any industry food, gifts, samples, or support of residency activities were designated pharma-free. Results The survey response rate was 62.2% (286/460). Among responding family medicine residencies, 52.1% refused drug samples, 48.6% disallowed industry gifts or food, 68.5% forbade industry-sponsored residency activities, and 44.1% denied industry access to students and residents at the family medicine center. Seventy-five residencies (26.2%) were designated as pharmafree. Medical-school-based and medical-school-administered residencies were no more likely than community-based residencies to be pharma-free. Among the 211 programs that permitted interaction, 68.7% allowed gifts or food, 61.1% accepted drug samples, 71.1% allowed industry representatives access to trainees in the family medicine center, and 37.9% allowed industry-sponsored residency activities. Respondents commented on challenges inherent to limiting industry interactions. Many programs noted recent changes in plans or practices. Conclusions Most family medicine residencies limit industry interaction with trainees.

We use the model to estimate the effects of four solar energy policy interventions on photovoltaic (PV) investments, government expenditure, economic outputs, CO2e emissions and the uses of steel, aluminium, concrete and energy. The results of our analysis call for the abolition of the PV donor gift policy, the improvement of production efficiency in the PV industry and the establishment of after-sales services and rural financing institutions. A 100 W peak (Wp) PV under this recommendation would be affordable for 80.6% of rural households that are projected to be without access to electricity in 2029. Net metering is the most effective policy for encouraging urban people to invest in PV in a situation where fossil energy prices are increasing and PV prices are declining. A donor gift policy may induce USD 51.9 new economic outputs for every Wp of PV operating to capacity in 2029, but would require a subsidy of USD 18.6/Wp. The recommended policies do not require subsidies and reduce CO2eq emissions and the consumption of aluminium, energy, steel and concrete by between 83.1% and 89.7% more than the existing policy. Several policy implications are discussed in response to these findings.

Two hundred and forty-four Taiwanese individuals aged 20 or above completed measures of variables of interest. Structural equation modeling showed that goodness of value and intention naturally group together and form a unique appraisal belief (i.e., perceived goodness). Moreover, path analyses indicated that perceived goodness acted as a full mediator of the association between trait and state gratitude. In other words, people with higher levels of trait gratitude had a propensity to perceive greater value of the gift itself and the helper's genuine helpful intentions, which may elevate their degree of state gratitude. Furthermore, a multigroup analysis found that the paths did not differ by gender. Implications for future research and limitations of the present findings are discussed.",4,4,Psychology

For each cohort, descriptive data were gathered and principal components analyses were performed on scales of interest and personality inventories. In addition, a cluster analysis was performed for the second cohort. The finding supported the hypothesis that profiling could be used to identify creative adolescents for career development programs. Both principal components analyses and cluster analyses revealed profiles of fine and performing arts students: one or two profiles of interpersonally talented groupings: and an engineering/technical profile. Creative students were more agreeable than those in previous studies, and there was strong evidence for crossover arts/science profiles.",27,28,Psychology

This research study used a dataset of 1676 observations of junior high school students from Northern Vietnam to explore students' academic achievement and its association with their reading passion, family socio economic condition, parental education and occupational aspiration. The empirical results show that higher grades in STEM-related subjects are predicted by reading interest (beta(Readbook) = 0.425, p < 0.0001), with students who love reading books achieve higher score than those who take no interest in books. Remarkably, the education level of the mother strongly enhances academic performance, with beta = 0.721 (p < 0.0001) in cases of mother having a university diploma or higher. Students coming from wealthy families are more likely to buy books whereas borrowing from the library is the main source of books for students who grow up in not-rich families. However, even among wealthy families, investment into buying books still rely more on personal interest, despite the aforementioned educational benefits of book reading, as evidenced by an over 7 percentage point disparity between the likelihood of purchasing books among wealthy-family students who took an interest in reading (45%) versus students of the same background who did not like to read (38.7%).

This calls for new approaches in evaluation and development of relevant abilities and skills. However, the current educational systems might miss some students who have high potential for this field or who can develop such potential. For example, according to the results of one Russian study, gifted children may be missed by existing methods of talent search, partially due to the lack of standardised psychometric tests, especially of abilities beyond verbal and numerical abilities. One important predictor of STEM, often neglected in education, is spatial ability. Recently an online short spatial ability battery (OSSAB) for use in adolescent populations was developed. However, no published norms are available. The aim of this study was to develop normalised thresholds for spatial ability testing using OSSAB battery with Russian 13-17 year old schoolchildren. Schoolchildren from the Sirius Educational Centre, demonstrating high achievement in 3 different areas: science (N = 640; 238 females), sports (N = 436; 67 females) and art (N = 260; 204 females), and schoolchildren (N = 752; 350 females) from general education schools of the Russian Federation participated in the study. Age of participants: 13-17 (M = 15.01; SD = 1.18). The study identified thresholds for 8 spatial ability levels: from Very low ability to Extraordinary giftedness. These thresholds can be used by teachers and school psychologists to determine the level of spatial ability in schoolchildren of 13-17 years of age. Based on individual students' current levels of spatial ability, teachers can provide individual support and recommendations. For high performance recommendations may include additional classes in STEM or natural sciences, for example, electronics, robotics, programming, physics or chemistry. For lower performance recommendations may include computer games containing spatial components; sports; playing musical instruments; origami classes; and studying the Chinese language. More broadly, school curricula in different subjects should include more spatial elements, such as: inclusion of stereometric tasks in learning materials; computer programs for modelling in teaching geometry and other subjects; adding visualizations (graphs and tables) when explaining material. Overall, the results of this study suggest that a significant number of children have very low or very high level of spatial ability in both mainstream schools and in educational centres for high-preforming students.

In this context, quite a lot of opinions and worldviews of thinkers of different historical eras, including Plato, Confucius and others, were analyzed regarding the definition of the concept of giftedness in children. The neurophysiological features of mental thinking were also investigated. It was concluded that giftedness is a unique combination of abilities that are the result of neurophysiological processes, which is a prerequisite for achieving certain successes or certain achievements in a certain activity. Thanks to such unique features, the child differs from others in a certain way. Giftedness is some unique feature of children, which is determined by the neurophysiological features of the body's development. The relevance of such topics is extremely important, because the scientific and technical development of modern society forces creative approaches in solving a number of problems. The presence of a perfect system for identifying and educating gifted and creative children is a necessary component of the successful activity of society. The purpose of the article is to clarify the necessary features and signs of giftedness in children with the aim of developing effective mechanisms for diagnosing giftedness in children of different age groups and methods of its development as an aspect of the neurophysiological approach to personality.

The present study therefore (a) attempts to shed light on changes over one semester in student-teacher agreement on six dimensions of goal structures (task, autonomy, recognition, grouping, evaluation, and time) in mathematics classes. In addition, we address the question (b) whether differentiated developmental trajectories of student-teacher agreement emerge for the period before vs. after the first mathematics test in the semester. Furthermore, the study (c) examines whether and how students' self-concept and indicators of students' initial and actual achievement are (reciprocally) related to agreement and changes in agreement. Data for this study was collected at five measurement points in newly assembled classes (Grade 9) after a transition within secondary education. The sample contained 130 students and their mathematics teachers, resulting in 130 student-teacher dyads. Applying piecewise growth curve modeling indicated changes in agreement regarding recognition, evaluation, and time. Higher increases in self-concept before the test forecasted declines in agreement regarding autonomy after the test. Moreover, we found effects of achievement on changes in agreement for the dimensions of autonomy, evaluation and time.

This study investigates the relations between cognitive ability and two distinct dimensions of perfectionism and addresses the role of parental antecedents of perfectionism in adolescents at different levels of cognitive ability. Method In a community sample of 3,168 adolescents and their parents, cognitive ability was assessed and perfectionism levels and parenting practices were surveyed. Results Adolescents higher in cognitive ability reported higher levels of Personal Standards (i.e., setting ambitious objectives) but lower levels of Concern over Mistakes (i.e., worrying excessively about mistakes). Parental criticism, high parental expectations, and conditionally regarding parenting were associated positively with Concern over Mistakes, and high parental expectations were related positively to Personal Standards. These associations were generally independent of adolescents' cognitive ability. Parents of adolescents higher in cognitive ability relied less on parenting practices associated with the development of perfectionism. Conclusion Cognitive ability is related to a higher pursuit of personal standards, yet does not constitute a risk factor for excessive concerns about mistakes. Parental antecedents were related similarly and in theoretically meaningful ways to adolescent perfectionism across different levels of cognitive ability.",4,4,Psychology

In surveys, 65 % percent of respondents indicated a donation to an agency providing healthcare in Nigeria the previous year, 57 % indicated having gone on medical service trips in the prior 10 years and 45 % indicated it was very likely or likely that they would return to Nigeria to practice medicine. In interviews, respondents tended to favor gifts in kind and financial gifts as modes of contribution, with medical education facilities as the most popular target. Personal connections, often forged in medical school, tended to facilitate contributions. Individuals desiring to return permanently focused on their potential impact and worried about health system under-preparedness; those not desiring permanent return centered on how safety, financial security and health systems issues presented barriers. Conclusions: This study demonstrates several mechanisms by which health systems may benefit from expatriate engagement. Greater identification of reliable local partners for diaspora, deeper collaboration with those partners and a focus on sustainable interventions might improve the quantity and impact of contributions. Ethnic medical associations have a unique role in organizing and facilitating diaspora response. Public-private partnerships may help diaspora negotiate the challenges of repatriation.",12,12,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"

Nine focus groups were run with medical students in their second year and upwards at three Polish medical universities. Initially, most students had difficulty in discerning pharmaceutical companies' presence in their education, but on reflection they all recognised this presence. Students said that they were surrounded by small medical gifts provided by companies, met pharmaceutical representatives, and took part in events for physicians organised and/or sponsored by the pharmaceutical industry. Nevertheless, they did not think they were the main target of the industry's marketing activities, saying that these were largely aimed at practicing doctors, and that they were only targeted as opportunities arose. Students' statements make it clear that their socialisation takes place within a culture which consents to medical professionals' cooperation with the industry. Medical students come to perceive cooperation with the industry as natural, and benefits from the industry as a privilege of doctors. Medical schools can prevent this by introducing guidelines, conflict of interest polices, and changing the formal curriculum, but the need for such measures is not currently recognised in Poland.",3,3,Health Care Sciences & Services; Sociology

The results indicated that the percentage of individuals taking supplements was 45.7% for men and 52.2% for women. There were no significant differences in supplement use by gender, age group, geographic stratum, current employment status, household monthly income, self-reported health status or marital status, except for higher education and adequate perceived financial resources. Half of both men and women chose to take only one supplement. In addition, as the number of supplements taken increased, the number of people decreased. The elderly with higher education levels were more likely to take two kinds of supplements. The top five supplements consumed from highest to lowest were: glucosamine, multivitamins and minerals, calcium, fish oil and vitamin B complex. The major reason for supplements use for men was to supplement an unbalanced diet, and that for women was to prevent joint degeneration. The main factor influencing choice of supplements in the elderly was receiving the supplement as a gift from another person. Note that mean intakes of vitamins A, C, E.

Students of primary and secondary educational institutions of the city participated in charity performances and concerts, sewed linen and warm clothes, made gifts for soldiers, and donated money. Teachers regarded this as a part of the education of patriotism. Charity organizations and the press actively propagated and replicated the image of a child who made a feasible contribution to solving social problems of wartime, as one of the ways to consolidate and mobilize Russian society. However, citizens' attitude to the practice was ambiguous. On the one hand, they financially supported charitable actions with participation of children.

This study answers this question using data obtained from a peer-led Facebook group with more than 175,000 participants, mostly in African countries, particularly Nigeria. A reflexive thematic analysis was used to analyze 100 public wall posts and 3860 comments posted on the group between June 2018 and May 2019. Four distinctive interpretations of virginity loss comprising the gift, precondition, stigma, and process emerged from the data. These interpretations were also gendered, such that a woman's virginity was interpreted as a gift but a stigma for men. The wall posts and comments further suggest that saving sex for marriage may have some culturally sensitive benefits, including trust, and marital sexual satisfaction. Altogether the findings expand the current understanding of the diverse perceived benefits of virginity that move beyond honour and respect to more complex benefits like trust in a union, sexual satisfaction and ultimate satisfaction in marriage.",4,4,Social Sciences - Other Topics

In fact neither of these statements is completely true. The roots of STS can be traced back to two different movements in the 1930s and 1950s respectively, but the social group which backed it during the 1970s was, in many ways, unlike any which had gone before. This makes it a very interesting development. And it is also true that STS is now recovering its strength, although it has now taken on yet another new form to suit the present times. This paper will attempt to define the original sponsors of STS by their special purpose and identity, perceived adversaries, and goals.

Findings indicated that, with regard to the preservice teachers' selective attention, they attended more to the teacher's pedagogy in the video than to students and students' statistical thinking. Analysis of the preservice teachers' knowledge-based reasoning revealed that they were more likely to use an interpretive stance than a descriptive or an evaluate stance to reason about what they observed. The preservice teachers, however, were less likely to draw on their statistical knowledge needed for teaching to reason about students' statistical thinking. Rather, the preservice teachers' noticing was informed by their general pedagogical knowledge or knowledge that was unrelated to statistical thinking.

Twenty-one participants ran overground around an athletic track at their preferred speed for 3 min, immediately followed by a 3-min treadmill run and a further 3-min overground run. During the treadmill run, participants were blinded to the speed display and were free to adjust the speed until it was perceived similar as their previous self-selected overground speed. A video camera was used to determine the average running speed during each overground run. A one-way ANOVA with repeated measures was used to detect differences among the three speeds: overground speed during session 1 (OG1), perceived overground speed on the treadmill (TM), and overground speed during session 2 (OG2). A significant difference among the three running speeds was found (P = .039). Post hoc analyses showed that the treadmill speed was much slower than both overground speeds but the overground speed did not differ between session 1 and session 2 (OG1: 3.99 (0.78) m/s, TM: 2.73 (0.62) m/s, OG2: 3.80 (0.74) m/s). These findings confirmed that one's perception of speed was influenced by the treadmill on which individuals were unable to match their corresponding self-selected overground running speed. The unmatched perception of speed is likely due to the distortion of normal visual inputs resulting from the discrepancy between observed and expected optic flow. Clinicians, therapists and treadmill users should be aware of the different psychological demands between treadmill and overground locomotion when selecting gait speed. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Two types of underachievement emerged: Sustained and Growing Underachievement. An Achievement class was also consistently found. Sustained underachievement was not associated with declining self-concept or task importance, but was related to moderately lower psychological cost value, self-worth, and middle school achievement. Growing underachievement was associated with relatively lower levels of self-concept and task importance that declined over time, similar to the achievement patterns.

However, the lack of readiness of teachers to accept and practically implement innovations significantly reduces the effectiveness of innovations introduced into the educational process. The renewed practice of general education makes qualitatively new demands on teachers and educators. Pedagogical education is increasingly under the influence of forces dictating the need for its intensive development. Teachers already today must prepare for the organization of educational systems of the future, and therefore pedagogical universities face problems that they previously did not solve. Methods: The analysis of the works of scientists, educators on information educational technologies examines the problems of pedagogy in the conditions of reforming school education, positive tendencies and constraints, the role of activity in the development of information educational technologies. Study and analysis of scientific literature, materials and documents. Hence, pedagogical technology is a set of rules and corresponding pedagogical methods and methods of influencing the development, education and upbringing of a schoolboy [Pedagogy: Theories, Systems, Technology, 2010]. Findings: Modern information technologies of education are in the stage of dynamic renewal, the impulse to which was, on the one hand, the processes of reforming society as a whole, and, on the other, the logic of the development of the educational system itself. The system of general education develops in the direction of increasing its differentiation, variability, the integration of educational programs, the humanization of education. Recognition of the need for innovative transformations in pedagogical science facilitated the emergence of innovative schools in large numbers, the introduction of new technologies into the pedagogical process. What is pedagogical technology? There are many answers to this question, sometimes not matching each other. This suggests that the theory and practice of pedagogical technology is only being developed. According to S.I.Ozhegov's dictionary: technology is a certain set of processes in a certain industry, as well as a scientific description of the methods of production. Technology (from the Greek: techne - art, skill, skill, logos - word, teaching) - the totality of methods implemented in any process [Ozhegov and Shvedova, 2008]. Improvements: In recent years, a new area of knowledge has become increasingly important: innovative pedagogy or pedagogical innovation. This is the sphere of science that studies new technologies, the development processes of the school, and the new practice of education. The word: innovation comes from the Latin inovatis (in - novus - new) and in translation means renewal, novelty, change [Duisenbaev, 2015]. Thus: Innovative pedagogy is a branch of pedagogical science that studies the process of updating pedagogical activity, its principles, laws, methods and means (the teaching about the creation of pedagogical innovations, their evaluation and mastering by the pedagogical community, use and application in practice) [Education and Science. Encyclopedic Dictionary, 2008].",1,1,Education & Educational Research

Under the philosophy of the GIFT framework, industry-standard multi-patch Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS) definition of the geometry is considered, and the adaptive discretization is achieved with the help of PHT-splines. The approach tracks the variation of density of an element, refining the sub-domains such that the boundary between the material and the non-material domain has a proper resolution. The proposed approach has threefold merits: (i) Complex multi-patch NURBS geometries could be constructed in any professional computer-aided design package and exported for analysis; (ii) The topology optimization problem could initially be solved on a relatively coarse mesh and refined progressively for substantial computational gains; (iii) Taking benefit of the GIFT framework, we can exactly represent conic sections in our computational model, thus altogether avoiding any geometric error during refinement. The accuracy and computational efficiency of the proposed framework are studied by comparing the adaptive solution to the non-adaptive solution. The proposed approach achieves a 30%-60% reduction in degree's-of-freedom and an 80%-90% reduction in CPU time compared to the non-adaptive case. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Students of three higher and continuing education institutes were divided into groups and were encouraged to solve specific problems and eventually to understand the concepts and the deployment of semantic technologies through their practical involvement. The aims of the teaching approach are for students to become familiar with , technologies, to annotate historical data and to understand the importance of annotating cultural information for enabling further processing and exploitation of the identified data relationships. Design/methodology/approach - Initially the aims of the teaching case were set and specific problems associated with them were designed. A start-up lecture on the basic concepts of XML was presented and then students were challenged with ill-defined problems as the problem-based learning method advises. Students then presented and discussed their solutions and approaches. At the end of each problem-based section the knowledge of the students was assessed. On the completion of the teaching case, the students' opinions were surveyed and the results towards the approach were very positive. Findings - The students provided solutions to the problems presented, and their opinions at the end of the teaching approach indicated that students preferred the problem-based approach to the lecture-based method. Students argued that, although learning on their own and with little help from the instructors is more demanding, it has specific advantages. They mentioned that they can work at their own pace and better understand the concepts involved. The skills and the knowledge acquired are transferrable to other situations.

Through a single-case experimental design and 766 test items, multiple measurements were performed on a 14-year-old junior high school science-gifted student. During the test, self-efficacy, item difficulty, cognitive load, and test performance (long-term test performance [LT-tp] and short-term test performance [ST-tp]) were examined to establish the construct of EEG-detected, real-time flow states (EEG-Fs). Based on the chi-square test of independence results, the EEG-F had a significant correlation with the student's cognitive load, self-efficacy, LT-tp, and item difficulty.

Self-regulation develops rapidly during the toddler years, yet few studies have examined toddlers' self-regulation in relation to concurrent child weight. Further, few studies compare child responses in food and non-food-related tasks. Our goal was to examine toddlers' observed behavioral and emotional self-regulation in food and non-food tasks in relation to their body mass index z-score (BMIz) and weight status (overweight/obese vs. not). Observational measures were used to assess self-regulation (SR) in four standardized tasks in 133 low-income children (M age = 33.1 months; SD = 0:6). Behavioral SR was measured by assessing how well the child could delay gratification for a snack (food-related task) and a gift (non-food-related task). Emotional SR was measured by assessing child intensity of negative affect in two tasks designed to elicit frustration: being shown, then denied a cookie (food-related) or a toy (non-food-related). Task order was counterbalanced. BMIz was measured. Bivariate correlations and regression analyses adjusting for child sex, child race/ethnicity, and maternal education were conducted to examine associations of SR with weight. Results were that better behavioral SR in the snack delay task associated with lower BMIz (beta = -0.27, p < 0.05) and lower odds of overweight/obesity (OR = 0.66, 95% CI 0.45, 0.96), but behavioral SR in the gift task did not associate with BMIz or weight status. Better emotional SR in the non-food task associated with lower BMIz (beta = -0.27, p < 0.05), and better emotional SR in food and non-food tasks associated with lower odds of overweight/obesity (OR = 0.65, 95% CI 0.45, 0.96 and OR = 0.56, 95% CI 0.37, 0.87, respectively). Results are discussed regarding how behavioral SR for food and overall emotional SR relate to weight during toddlerhood, and regarding early childhood obesity prevention implications.

In these circumstances, large London publishers, annually producing luxury gift books for Christmas, trying to adjust to the mass excitement around the Eastern art, invited young and promising graphic artists to illustrate these publications. Among the invited artists who actively cooperated with such publishers was the outstanding French-English illustrator Edmund Dulac (1882-1953). The article reveals one of the key aspects of Dulac's oeuvre. The author considers artist's attempts to convey the thematic and stylistic originality of the Oriental art in the context of book illustration of the Edwardian era and the second decade of XXth century. The work traces Edmund Dulac's creative career and examines the cycles of his illustrations in order to identify both typical and original stylistic and compositional techniques used by the author to create works in the spirit of orientalist aesthetics. The article also deals with oriental works of Dulac's contemporaries and analyzes them in comparison with each other.",0,0,Arts & Humanities - Other Topics

Currently, he is the Head of the Analysis, Geometry and Topology Department and Deputy Director of IMI-BAS. His main research interests are in the areas of Complex Analysis, Complex Differential Geometry, and Twistor theory. Another important aspect of Oleg's professional involvements is his work with mathematically gifted high school students. He himself benefited from the Bulgarian system of identifying mathematical talents at an early age leading to his participation in IMO'1969, Romania. Since then, he has been involved in numerous activities dealing with nurturing and developing young mathematical talents. We present a conversation with him illustrating what his favorite problems are and why. Unlike the traditional situations in which the professor expects the students to come to a solution (possibly with his help), he presents a solution containing mistakes to a well-defined problem and throw the gauntlet down for them: Find the mistakes in the solution! We provide a specific example in support of his conviction that such problems are crucial in math education (since everyone, even a professional mathematician, makes errors on an everyday basis). The phases the talk in front of the white board went through were: To feel that something is wrong in his original solution. To discover where the mistake is. Finally, to find a correct solution to the problem. The very process of starting with a wrong idea, becoming aware of the error in reasoning, and finally, succeeding to correct it, which Oleg Mushkarov has kept reproducing when teaching a course on extracurricular math activities to his undergraduate students, reveals his dedication and talents to teaching in addition to his research achievements.",0,0,Education & Educational Research

Horrabin and a workers' economic and political geography,ANTIPODE,,,"This paper examines the life and geographical writings of the English socialist J.F. (Frank) Horrabin (1884-1962) and his attempts to construct a socialist geography. Horrabin was an active socialist in the Labour Party, Fabian Society, and other leftwing groups and very involved in working-class education through the Plebs League and National Council of Labour Colleges. He was also a journalist, cartoonist, and gifted cartographer. His 1923 text An Outline of Economic Geography, which sold in large numbers and was translated into nine other languages, attempted to provide workers with an account of economic (and political and historical) geography that used bourgeois pure geography but put it within a socialist and historical-materialist framework. Unlike Germany and some other countries, England did not have a strong Marxist theoretical tradition, and Horrabin's approach does not develop theory (though it did attract the admiration of the German Marxist Karl Wittfogel). Rather, it sets out to be engaged in practical political education. Horrabin's work was developed within a particular context, but his geographical writings (and pioneering political cartography) exemplify one way of linking geography with political practice, and this paper examines these relationships. Many of Horrabin's concerns find echoes in current radical geography, and his work deserves belated recognition and a place in the history of geography.",9,9,Geography

This study aimed to determine the prevalence and risk factors for HIV infection among young Thai men. Methods A total survey was conducted of Royal Thai Army new conscripts, participating in the national HIV surveillance in November 2010 and May 2011. Behavioral risk factors for HIV infection were determined using a standardized survey questionnaire in the total study population and men who have sex with men (MSM) subgroup. Results A total of 301 (0.5%) HIV infected young Thai men were identified from the total study population (63,667). Independent risk factors associated with HIV infection among the total study population included being single (adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR] 1.6, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.1-2.2), having no formal education (AOR 6.5, 95% CI 2.3-18.4) or a bachelor's degree (AOR 1. 8, 95% CI 1.0-3.0), engaging in bisexual (AOR 3.7, 95% CI 2.4-5. 6) or exclusively homosexual activity (AOR 14.4, 95% CI 10.4-19.8), having a history of Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI) (AOR 2.3, 95% CI 1.6-3.3) and having sex in exchange for gifts/money (AOR 2.0, 95% CI 1. 5-2.8). A total of 4,594 (7.9%) MSM were identified, of which 121 (2.6%) were HIV infected. The prevalence of HIV infection among MSM in urban (2.8%) and rural (2.4%) areas were relatively comparable (p-value = 0.44). Of the identified MSM, 82.5% reported having sexual desire with females only. Risk factors associated with HIV infection in the MSM subgroup included living in the western region (AOR 3.5, 95% CI 1.2-10.4), having a bachelor's degree (AOR 2.7, 95% CI 1.2-5.7), having a history of exclusive receptive (AOR 3.6, 95% CI 1.6-7.7) or versatile anal sex (AOR 4.7, 95% CI 3.0-7.5) and history of having sex in exchange for gifts/money (AOR 2.3, 95% CI 1.5-3.5). Conclusion The prevalence of HIV infection among young Thai men has continued to be below 0.5% in 2010 and 2011. High risk sexual activity, including MSM, played a major role in the HIV epidemic among this population. Effective HIV prevention programs should cover MSM who have heterosexual desire as well as having sex in exchange for gifts/money and be implemented in both urban and rural areas.",6,6,Science & Technology - Other Topics

The research builds on previous broader research into the views of tax experts in Croatia. The current research objectives include: revealing citizens' views about the most important tax issues, establishing the influence of demographic characteristics and attitudes towards redistribution on their answers, and the comparison of their views with those of tax experts. On the one hand, citizens mostly advocate the abolishment of inheritance and gifts taxation, as well interest taxation, but on the other hand, they advocate the introduction of bank taxation and junk food taxation. They are in favour of broadening the reduced VAT rate to encompass all foodstuffs. The regression results suggest a strong influence of the redistributive notion of the tax system, followed by real estate ownership, income level, education level and work status. Comparison with the answers of professionals reveals a statistically significant difference.

Following the priorities of modem education aimed at the formation of students' independent thinking, creativity, tolerance, initiative, and communicability, the authors view the festival and competition movement as a form of development of dialogical thinking in teachers and students able to understand each other in the process of communicating on the topics of art, creativity, and social phenomena. The basis of the study is formed by the results of four children's drawing competitions held by the Federal State Research Institution of the Russian Academy of Education Institute of Art Education in 2019-2020 which involved 30 educational institutions and over 3,000 drawings, as well as teachers' reports and video and photographic recordings of the educational process and programs combining all types of participants' artistic activity (musical, theatrical, literary, fine art, decorative, constructive, design) at the final stages of festivals and competitions. The dialogue of arts practiced in the process of children's and teachers' participation in the festival and competition movement is disclosed in the present article as a method of dialogical thinking development manifesting in creative activity that has a motive, a goal, a system of actions and operations, a result and control. The goal of the study is to identify the aesthetic and personal priorities of children and adolescents in various types of art that allow determining the optimal system of motives, goals, actions, and operation in the course of the dialogue between a teacher and a student on the topics of art, creativity, and social and cultural events. It is concluded that the festival and competition movement presents an effective form of development of teacher's and student's dialogical thinking under certain conditions, namely the reliance on the age-specific and individual characteristics of a child's development, the formation of I am the author position in a child, and a teacher's understanding of a student's aesthetic and personal priorities.",2,2,Psychology

The aqueous extract, possessing high phenolic content (170.50 mg gallic acid equivalent/g extract), showed the highest reducing capacity (613.27 and 364.10 mg Trolox equivalent/g extract, for cupric reducing antioxidant capacity and ferric reducing antioxidant power, respectively), radical scavenging potential (469.82 mg Trolox equivalent/g extract, against 2,2 '-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)), metal chelating ability (52.39 mg ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid equivalent/g extract) and total antioxidant capacity (3.15 mmol Trolox equivalent/g extract). Liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-quadrupole time-of-flight-mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-QTOF-MS/MS) alloved to tentatively identify a total of 56 compounds in the extracts, including ellagitannins, gallic acid and galloyl derivatives amongst others. The ethyl acetate extracts substantially depressed cholinesterase enzymes (4.49 and 12.26 mg galantamine equivalent/g extract against AChE and BChE, respectively) and alpha-amylase enzyme (1.04 mmol acarbose equivalent/g extract).

In this presentation, I encourage critical and engaged scholar-ship by referring to examples of dangerous work that should receive more attention: social medicine in Latin America and the critique of managerial ideology in the United States. Although social medicine has become a widely, respected field of research, teaching, and clinical practice in Latin America, its accomplishments remain little known in the English-speaking world. For centuries, indigenous cultures in Latin America have held belief systems linking social conditions to patterns of illness and death. Latin American accounts of social medicine's history, emphasize its European origins, especially in the contributions of Rudolf Virchow. In the United States, with the impact of the Flexner Report (1910) and its supporters, Virchow's vision of social medicine went into decline. On the other hand, in Latin America, social medicine flourished as a focus of education and research. Since social medicine's golden age during the 1930s, teachers, researchers, and practitioners have produced major achievements despite the dangers of this work, which in several instances have included torture, imprisonment, or death. An ideology favoring managerial decision making in the United States has influenced crucial policy decisions, and the justifications for these decisions have manifested symbolic politics in addition to the evaluation of factual evidence. With ambiguous empirical support, managerial ideology has foster-ed the general growth of managed cave, the implementation of Medicaid managed care by state governments, the expansion of managed care in rural areas, and the impact of evidence-based medicine on policy and clinical decisions. If the occupational risks of critical work in the medical social sciences are not taken, we forfeit some of the most important gifts offered by the sociological imagination.",15,16,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Psychology; Biomedical Social Sciences; Sociology"

For instance, the delivery of seaweed as a nesting material has been typically considered a male specific trait. We assessed this assumption and determined whether the potential role of this behaviour is to serve as a nuptial trait preceeding copulation or to impart a thermal benefit for incubation. First, as predicted, all arriving individuals at the colony that mated following seaweed delivery assumed the top copulatory position, which is consistent with male behaviour in this species. In comparison, the likelihood of birds without seaweed copulating in top position upon arrival at the nest site was approx. 50%, indicating an even mix of the sexes. However, the sex of those individuals in our sample that did not copulate during our observations remains unresolved. Second, seaweed delivery was not related to copulation following arrival, as individuals arriving with seaweed in our sample had a lower probability of mating than did individuals arriving without seaweed. Third, to determine if seaweed provides thermoregulatory benefits to alleviate the physiological costs of incubation, the foot temperatures of incubating and non-incubating individuals and temperatures of nests with or without seaweed were recorded. Temperatures of the foot-webbings during incubation were significantly higher above ambient temperatures than those of non-incubating gannets at the colony. Nests that contained seaweed were significantly warmer at sunrise than those without seaweed. There was no consistent difference between the temperatures of nesting material in the evenings alone, with a large variance of evening nest temperatures. These correlative data are consistent with male specificity and thermoregulatory benefits associated with seaweed delivery in M. serrator, implying that further experimental work on known-sexed birds should focus on physiological benefits and reproductive consequences of seaweed delivery in this species.",12,14,Behavioral Sciences; Zoology

The first test tool(a) investigated student conceptions after reading explanations about physical phenomena in non-physics textbooks, while the second(b) investigated student conceptions after reading explanations revised by physics education experts about the same physical phenomena. The two test tools were applied to each class, and for a fair invetigation, test(a) followed by test(b) was applied to one class, while test(b) followed by test(a) was applied to the other class. The results were as follows: In both classes, the students' level of understanding from explanations revised by physics education experts was significantly (p <.01) higher than that from explanations in non-physics textbooks. As such, it is feasible that false or inappropriate explanations in non-physics textbooks can cause student misconceptions. Moreover, the improper expression of physical science concepts, improper choice of scientific terms, and incorrect grammatical structures, along with the use of unsuitable examples and improper model pictures can make it difficult for students to understand physics concepts. Furthermore, differences in the terms used in physics textbook and those used in other textbooks can also confuse students.",0,0,Education & Educational Research

Studies indicate that even simple video games are offering important educational benefits in classrooms with bilingual students from different countries. However, a need for identifying truly useful game for educational purposes exists. This article begins with an examination of lower level learning in so-called edutainment products and concludes with an example of how teachers can use computer games and video based activities as an advanced way to improve and enrich the existing curriculum. On the other hand, as a teacher, it is important to be aware of such technology and to know that these instruments can all be used in the classroom in some way. Can games based learning helps in eliminating racism problems, assisting the acceptance in small communities of the new immigrants, and can assist the gifted and talented students in their future plans? This essay identifies characteristics of highly cognitive virtual interactive environments and offers a detailed index and scoring rubric as a tool for teachers and preserves teachers to use when evaluating the tendencies a video game demonstrates toward encouraging higher order thinking in its participants.

Even though the algorithm is formally similar to the Rayleigh quotient iteration which is well-known in the linear situation, but they are essentially different. The point is that the standard Rayleigh quotient cannot be used as a shift in the non-linear setup. We have to employ a different quantity which has been obtained only recently.

Parental warm acceptance, contingent responsiveness, and verbal scaffolding were coded from the free play videos and aggregated to create a parental responsiveness latent variable. A cross-lagged panel structural equation model indicated that higher T1 parental responsiveness significantly predicted more positive gain in delay inhibition and conflict EF from T1 to T2. Higher T1 delay inhibition, but not T1 conflict EF, significantly predicted more positive change in parental responsiveness from T1 to T2. These associations were not explained by several possible confounding variables, including children's age, gender, race/ethnicity, and verbal ability.

1405,2004,"Trowbridge, LW",Physics for the lay student,TEACHING AND LEARNING OF PHYSICS IN CULTURAL CONTEXTS,,,"Public understanding of physics and physical principles in the United States is at a low point. The term physics appears to be frightening and intimidating to average individuals, perhaps because of its mathematical connotations or because of an aura of mystery about how the world works. Many individuals turn to occult, paranormal and metaphysical beliefs about phenomena encountered in their daily lives. The rational ideas of science appear to be less attractive to the minds of many than the superstitious or non-rational explanations promoted by many groups in the United States. Professional scientists, including physicists, have not succeeded in communicating effectively their task of explicating the workings of the universe to the average public. As a result, these scientists are frequently viewed as gurus or priests of the unknown, dealing in ideas far removed from the daily lives of average persons. Teachers of physical sciences in the elementary school in the U. S. are generally poorly trained in understanding science. Consequently, they avoid or poorly present information about science to their charges. Children thus develop a negative look about science that carried into adult life. Certain programs have been developed in the past decades to overcome the problems cited above. Usually, these are rather formal modes of presentation to children in the schools. In some cases, they are successful but to this point have not had widespread effect on solving the problem of poor understanding of physics by the public. Many problems still persist in developing scientific literacy among the general American public. With increasing awareness, the proliferation of technological devices in most American homes, and attention to early education in sciences, there is hope that these may become a medium for raising the literacy level in the sciences for average persons.",0,0,Education & Educational Research

The convolution features of the template branch and search area branch realize similarity matching and information fusion by a correlation operation. However, the correlation operation is a local linear matching, which limits the tracker to capturing the complex nonlinear relationship between the template branch and search area branch. In addition, it is easy to lose useful information. Moreover, most trackers do not update the template. The template branch and the search area branch compute convolution features independently without information exchange. To solve these existing problems, a graph attention information fusion for Siamese adaptive attention tracking network (GIFT) is proposed. The information flow between the template branch and search area branch is connected by designing a Siamese adaptive attention module (SAA), and the template information is updated indirectly. The graph attention information fusion module (GAIF) is proposed to effectively fuse the information of the template branch and search area branch and realize the similarity matching of their corresponding parts. Layerwise aggregation makes full use of the shallow and deep features of neural networks. This further improves tracking performance.

This is more relevant and important especially for concepts that are introduced formally as early as preschool including friction. Visual representation maybe often used as an aid to teaching, however, considering that creating visual representations allows students to make connections between experiences and specific concepts, it may be possible to use the same in revealing and diagnosing students' preconceptions. Purpose: This study attempted to explore the use of visual representations in identifying students' preconceptions in friction. The preconceptions were categorized and compared to those existing in literature. Sample: Using convenience sampling, a total of sixty-two grade 7 students, aged 12-13, from one school that represent the government schools for the gifted participated in the study. These schools follow a trilingual curriculum framework. Design and methods: Following the qualitative descriptive research design, visual representations produced by students prior to a lesson on friction were analyzed using the four-step approach to semiotic analysis of drawings. For verification and confirmation purposes, interviews were conducted. Thematic analysis was performed to identify and categorize the preconceptions. Results: Results revealed that students often associate friction to human activities such as sliding and rolling objects in flat surfaces and are contextual in nature. There exist limited preconceptions as proven with the non-representation of static friction and non-representation of friction at mesoscopic and microscopic levels. There also exist misconception and inconsistent preconception related to determining the direction of friction among sliding and rolling objects. Conclusion: This study shows that using visual representation paired with interview may be an effective and efficient diagnostic assessment alternative for concepts in friction and most likely to concepts that have similar nature to friction.",4,4,Education & Educational Research

The experimental and control group were each one constituted by 93 students from the 8th grade with successful academic achievement and six pre-service teachers of physics. The experimental group performed during one and a half months a set of physics activities. They were developed and implemented taking into account some strategies considered promoters of conceptual change by being facilitators of the development of critical thinking. During the same time, the control group performed physics activities not intentionally developed with the same purpose but based on the same contents. Several sources of data were used to collect data. The results seem to point out that the teacher's practices promoters of conceptual change by being facilitators of the development of critical thinking seem to be important factors that can influence if a pupil is a good or a week problem solver. Some implications of the study can be drawn for science education.",0,0,Education & Educational Research

Consent to donate is influenced by many factors and educational interventions are strongly recommended. Objective: To evaluate the impact of an educational, theater-based strategy on the attitudes toward organ donation. Methodology: This study employed an intervention using theater as the central tool. The impact of this intervention on the intention to donate was assessed through a controlled, prospective, nonrandomized designed study. The sample consisted of 1,038 people. All the participants answered a survey that asked about sex, age and intent to donate. Afterward, one portion of the sample was exposed to the play, The Gift of Life, and a subsequent discussion forum that was guided by experts. The same survey was administered again after the intervention. Results: Before the intervention, donation attitudes were positive in 68.3% of the responses, negative in 6.8% and uncertain in 24.9%. Females showed a greater intent to donate while age had no apparent influence on the donation decision. Those exposed to the intervention were found to be more likely to donate and show a favorable change in attitude toward donation than those who were not exposed to the intervention. Conclusion: An educational intervention using theater is an effective tool to generate a short-term change in the intent to donate. Educational strategies should be employed to increase the rates of organ donation.",4,4,General & Internal Medicine

Here, we developed a microchip embedded with a three-dimensional (3D) PDMS scaffold by a quadratic-sacrificing template method for high-efficiency capture of CTCs. The microchip was gifted with a 3D interconnected macroporous structure, strong toughness, and excellent flexibility and transparency, enabling fast isolation and convenient observation of CTCs. Especially, 3D scaffold chip perfectly integrates the two main strategies currently used for enhancement of cell capture efficiency. Spatially distributed 3D scaffold compels cells undergoing chaotic or vortex migration in the channel, and the spatially distributed nanorough skeleton offers ample binding sites, which synergistically and significantly improve CTCs capture efficiency. Our results showed that 1-118 CTCs/mL were identified from 14 cancer patients' blood and 5 out of these cancer patients showed 1-14 CTC clusters/mL. This work demonstrates for the first time the development of microchip with transparent interconnected 3D scaffold for isolation of CTCs and CTC dusters, which may promote in-depth analysis of CTCs.",54,54,Chemistry

Previous studies have already shown that both students and teachers have a positive attitude toward the use of SF movies in school science lessons. However, despite the advantages, using SF movies is an extra burden on science teachers, because it is hard for individual teachers to analyse and edit SF movies and then develop the necessary teaching materials. Therefore, to reduce this burden, the current authors developed a multimedia CD, named 'SF & Physics', which can easily be used by ordinary teachers in their science lessons. The CD focuses on the mechanics part of high school physics and contains lots of interesting movie clips taken from a variety of SF movies. In the process of developing the CD, comments and advice were collected from physics teachers and science educators. The CD was then shown in two high school classes and the results closely observed. It was found that both teachers and students were satisfied with the use of the CD and insightful recommendations were collected for future classroom implementation.",0,0,Education & Educational Research

American Psychologist, 34, 906-911.]. To date, the study of the use of metacognition by children with different levels of abilities (from those having a learning disability to those identified as gifted) has been mostly restricted to the cognitive abilities in academic areas such as reading, writing, or mathematics. The structure of knowledge has been more extensively explored in the expertise literature in the performance of both academic and psychomotor tasks. Similarities have been noted in the characteristic differences between experts and novices in both these types of tasks. Studies have begun to explore the use of metacognition in psychomotor tasks such as key strokes, ball throwing-catching, and running. It seems that, as with the structure of knowledge, parallels also exist in the use of metacognition by poor and proficient performers in academic and psychomotor tasks. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Communication between students and teachers is achieved by combining telephone, facsimile and computer links, and by providing different levels of teacher-student interaction. Teaching via telematics overcomes many of the problems of remote and distant learners as lessons are transmitted from the metropolitan area to a number of sites simultaneously. Previous research on telematics classrooms (McLoughlin & Oliver, 1995) indicates limitations on the forms that teacher-student interactions can take, and in particular the didactic teaching style that teachers adopt when teaching with audiographics. A recent initiative by the Education Department of Western Australia is seeking to extend the use of telematics for delivery of educational services to gifted and talented students in rural and remote areas. The aim of the project is to extend and apply innovative approaches to teaching via audiographics, and to foster higher order learning in the students by linking them with other students in the metropolitan and rural areas. The paper will outline an action research approach to developing a teaching-learning framework for application of telematics to learning environments seeking to promote higher order cognition.",0,0,Education & Educational Research

However, this hypothesis is supported by little compelling, population-based evidence, and no study has been conducted during the preschool period with a population-based sample. Method: Children (N = 1100) from the EDEN mother-child cohort were assessed at the age of 5-6 years. Behavioral, emotional and social problems (emotional symptoms, conduct problems, symptoms of hyperactivity/inattention, peer relationship problems and prosocial behavior) were measured using the parent-rated Strengths & Difficulties Questionnaires (SDQ). IQ scores were based on the WPPSI-III at 5-6 years. Relevant covariates for children's cognitive development were also collected. Results: We found no significant differences in SDQscores between gifted children (N = 23; Full Scale IQ > 130) and children with Full Scale IQin the normal range (N = 1058 >= 70 and <= 130), except a marginally significant association between high-IQ and emotional difficulties at 5-6 years. Further sensitivity analyses did not support the association between high-nand emotional difficulties.

They depend on the larval diet for nitrogenous resources. Consequently, there is a trade-off between the reproductive and somatic nitrogenous investments of adults. Furthermore, male butterflies invest a considerable amount into spermatophores, containing nitrogen, which they give to their sexual partners. One way in which male butterflies could potentially replenish their spermatophores is by flight muscle histolysis, which may reduce locomotor ability and lifespan. In the present study, the effect of mating experience on nitrogen dynamics and the lifespan of males is investigated in the satyrine butterfly Lethe diana (Butler). Mated males do not have less thoracic nitrogen than virgin males, suggesting that mating experiences do not induce spermatophore recovery through flight muscle histolysis. Mated males possess less abdominal nitrogen than virgin males at death, indicating that they cannot recover the lost nitrogenous resource used for a single mating. Lifespan does not differ between mated and virgin males. Thus, reproduction and longevity are not fuelled necessarily by the same shared resource pools. Spermatophore mass increases as males get older. Considering that resources for producing spermatophores are limited, males may adjust the spermatophore mass strategically, depending on their chances of future reproduction.",13,13,Entomology

He was one of a few sociologists who revived the discipline in the 1960s and was a talented organiser and a co-founder of the Faculty of Social Sciences at Charles University in the 1990s. He was also a gifted teacher. However, owing to his busy organisational role, extensive teaching activities, and the publishing ban and restrictions he was subject to during the communist era, it is difficult to define the 'real Petrusek' in terms of his sociological thinking. The author argues that insight into his thought can, paradoxically, be found in the work he did during the most restricted period of his life, i.e. in the late 1980s, when Petrusek and his colleague Josef Alan published Sociologicky obzor (Sociological Horizon), probably the only samizdat sociological journal in the world (1987-1989). In this journal Petrusek was not bound by external restrictions or his various other activities and he proved to be a particularly original analyst and thinker. He defined an 'alternative sociology', which was based primarily on the sociological analysis of literature and the performing arts as well as on his own profound knowledge of classical and contemporary sociology, which allowed him to shed light on a range of pressing contemporary social issues such as gender relations, the social perception of time and progress, the dissemination and dissolution of higher education, social stratification, and the approaching post-communist era. Petrusek contributed 83 different and, in the main, highly valued texts to Sociologicky obzor that often drew attention to the crucial social issues of late modernisation (not only in reference to communist societies) and criticised the academic impotence of the 'official' Marxist-Leninist sociology of the time.",0,0,Sociology

This paper explores the motivation, challenges, perspectives, and difficulties teachers encountered during their professional development in the Republic of Croatia. The empirical research was conducted online through a questionnaire on employees from the Industrial-Craft Vocational School and High School Marka Marulita Slatina during June 2021 on a sample of 63 respondents.

The most sought-after areas of development are teaching gifted and children with disabilities, better methodological knowledge, and more efficient use of information and communication technology in teaching. The limitation of this study was the insufficient sample size for the scientic confirmation of these theses, but the results do correlate with previously conducted studies.

A pre-intervention study was conducted to determine how to successfully carry out a possible future intervention to reduce HIV risk among adolescents in urban Zambia. Ethnographic and sexual data were collected on 276 males and females both attending and not attending secondary school during a 14-month period in 1992-1993. Additionally, several focus groups were conducted. This paper reviews the cultural background of Zambian adolescents and presents an overview of the study results. Among the findings, it was learned that most of the male and female adolescents (average age of 17) are sexually active, very few routinely use condoms, less than half of sexually active adolescents have ever used a condom, AIDS is omnipresent in Zambia, the threat of HIV infection is a very real concern for most of the adolescents, there is a strong desire to protect themselves from HIV infection during sex (but condoms are often seen as ineffective and other forms of safer sex are not discussed), nearly all of the sexually active females and some of the males have received money or gifts for sex, and some of the out-of-school females are engaging in very risky sex (e.g., unprotected anal intercourse, and anilingus) with adult men. The ethnographic data, including a brief trial risk reduction workshop, suggests that the core values and social norms of the adolescents may shape behavioral change. A value utilization/norm change (VUNC) model is developed, which is intended to provide a conceptual framework for understanding how to utilize selected core values of the adolescents to strengthen or alter norms within the social networks in order to elicit desired HIV risk reduction.

The availability of these anatomical gifts to treat individuals with severe disfiguring injuries relies largely on decisions made by family members. If vascularized composite allograft transplantation is to become more readily available, the knowledge and beliefs of the general public must be explored to ensure vascularized composite allograft donation approaches adequately support the donation decision-making process. Methods: We conducted six focus groups with 53 members of the general public, which were audio-recorded for accuracy and transcribed. Before each session, participants completed a brief survey assessing donation-related knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs. Analysis of qualitative data entailed the constant comparison method in the development and application of a schema for thematic coding. Descriptive statistics and Spearman's rank coefficient were used in the analysis of the quantitative data. Results: Respondents were most knowledgeable about solid organ donation and least knowledgeable about vascularized composite allograft donation. Six major themes emerged: (1) strong initial reactions toward vascularized composite allografts, (2) limited knowledge of and reservations about vascularized composite allografts, (3) risk versus reward in receiving a vascularized composite allograft, (4) information needed to authorize vascularized composite allograft donation, (5) attitudes toward donation, and (6) mistrust of the organ donation system. Conclusion: The general public has low levels of knowledge and high levels of hesitation about vascularized composite allograft donation and transplantation. Education campaigns to familiarize the general public with vascularized composite allografts and specialized training for donation professionals to support informed family decision-making about vascularized composite allograft donation may address these issues.",0,0,General & Internal Medicine

Their primary purpose is the protection of user data, both in transit and at rest. One of the de facto methods to evaluate block cipher security is differential cryptanalysis. Differential cryptanalysis observes the propagation of input patterns (input differences) through the cipher to produce output patterns (output differences). This probabilistic propagation is known as a differential; the identification of which is a measure of a block cipher's security margins. This paper introduces an optimized GPU-based branch-and-bound framework for differential search. We optimize search efficiency by parallelizing all branch-and-bound operations, completing the entire search on the GPU without communicating with the CPU. The meet-in-the-middle (MITM) approach is also adopted for further performance gains. We analyze the financial and computational costs of the proposed framework using Google Cloud VM to showcase its practicality. When optimized for performance, we can attain up to 90x speedup while saving up to 47% of the running cost as compared to a single CPU core. When optimized for cost, the proposed framework can save up to 83% of financial costs while retaining a speedup of up to 40x. As a proof of concept, the proposed framework was then applied on 128-bit TRIFLE-BC, 64-bit PRESENT, and 64-bit GIFT. Notably, we identified the best differentials for PRESENT (16 rounds) and 64-bit GIFT (13 rounds) to date, with estimated probabilities of 2(-61.7964) and 2(-60.66) respectively. Although the differential results for TRIFLE-BC were incremental, the proposed framework was able to construct differentials for 43 rounds that consisted of approximately 5.8x more individual trails than previous work, making it one of the most efficient approaches for larger block ciphers.",1,1,Computer Science

The decrease in the number of eggs contained in autumn-morph females indicated that they started oviposition in mid-April. The shape of the spermatophore suggested that autumn-morph females could re-mate with autumn-morph males before mid-April. Although the eupyrene sperm of the summer-morph males remained in the spermatheca just after overwintering, the nuptial gift hypothesis is more plausible than the risk-hedge hypothesis because most females re-mated in the spring before the onset of oviposition. A counter-adaptation of summer-morph males acting as a strategy for mating with autumn-morph females was also discussed.",15,15,Entomology

This study examined the effects of an intervention that targeted family child care provider responsiveness on children's EF. Family child care providers were randomly assigned to one of two intervention groups or a control group. An intervention group that received a responsiveness-focused online professional development course and another intervention group that received this online course plus weekly mentoring were collapsed into one group because they did not differ on any of the outcome variables. Children (N = 141) ranged in age from 2.5 to 5 years (mean age = 3.58 years; 52% female). At pretest and posttest, children completed delay inhibition tasks (gift delay-wrap, gift delay-bow) and conflict EF tasks (bear/dragon, dimensional change card sort), and parents reported on the children's level of attention problems. Although there were no main effects of the intervention on children's EF, there were significant interactions between intervention status and child age for delay inhibition and attention problems. The youngest children improved in delay inhibition and attention problems if they were in the intervention rather than the control group, whereas older children did not. These results suggest that improving family child care provider responsive behaviors may facilitate the development of certain EF skills in young preschool-age children. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

However, few researchers specifically focus on the barriers to and facilitators of empowerment in Iranian people with diabetes. Understanding the factors could help health professionals facilitate self-empowerment more effectively. This study aims to determine the barriers to and facilitators of empowerment in Iranian people with diabetes. A qualitative exploratory study was conducted using in-depth interviews to collect the data from 11 women and men in 2007. Themes were identified using constant comparative analysis method. Common barriers to empowerment were similar to other chronic diseases: prolonged stress, negative view about diabetes, ineffective health-care systems, poverty and illiteracy. Diabetes education, fear of diabetes' complications, self-efficacy and hope for a better future emerged as being crucial to empowerment. Facilitators specific to Iranians were: the power of religion and faith, the concept of the doctor as holy man, accepting diabetes as God's will, caring for the body because it was God's gift and support from families especially daughters. Empowerment was strongly influenced by cultural and religious beliefs in Iran and the power of faith emerged as an important facilitator of diabetes empowerment. The findings will help health professionals understand how Iranian people with diabetes view life and the factors that facilitate empowerment.",38,40,Nursing

None of the prospective teachers explicitly interpreted the student's limited understanding of variability when comparing data sets with unequal sample sizes. There was a gradation in their noticing skill, ranging from those who showed no evidence of differentiating between students' different levels of reasoning and made general pedagogical decisions to those who differentiated between students' developmental levels and decided how to respond based on students' existing understanding as well as identifying the intrinsic statistical properties in students' solutions.

Benefitting from a facile one-pot synthesis strategy, the elastomer was prepared at low temperature (80 degrees C) and was characterized clearly afterward. The azide-terminated polyether and acetylene-terminated benzoxazine were used as the soft and hard segments, respectively, in the polymer chain. Because the triazole rings served as stable linkage between the soft and hard segments, the elastomer possessed good thermal stability (the 5% weight loss temperature could exceed 350 degrees C) compared to traditional elastomers, such as polyurethane. The rigid benzoxazine rings provided the product with good mechanical properties (the tensile strength of the elastomer could exceed 30 MPa). Furthermore, the ring-opening polymerization of oxazine rings in the structure gifted the elastomer with possibility of thermally induced structural transformation. The thermally induced structural transformation could conveniently realize the conversion of the elastomer to a thermosetting resin. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym.

Promotoras (community health workers), who are effective at advocating and spearheading health promotion efforts in the Latinx community, show promise in their ability to educate about organ donation and donor registration. Objective: This study aimed (1) to develop an interactive, evidence-based program to educate promotoras about organ donation, the need for organ donors in the Latinx American community, and ways to register as deceased organ donors and (2) to train promotoras to lead discussions about organ donation and to promote the act of donor registration. Methods: In partnership with 4 promotoras organizations, the culturally targeted Promotoras de Donacion eLearning module was developed based on input from 12 focus groups conducted with Latina women (n=61) and promotoras (n=37). Formative work, existing literature, the Vested Interest Theory, and the Organ Donation Model guided curriculum development. In partnership with the Gift of Life Institute and regional promotoras, the curriculum was designed, filmed, and developed in a visually appealing module interface. The module was beta-tested with promotoras before launch. Results: Promotoras de Donacion, available in Spanish with English subtitling, lasts just over an hour. The module comprised 6 sections including various activities and videos, with the curriculum divided into a skills-based communication component and a didactic educational component. Pre- and posttests assessed the module's direct effects on promotoras' organ donation knowledge and attitudes as well as confidence promoting the act of donor registration. Conclusions: This novel, theoretically and empirically based intervention leveraged the existing network of promotoras to promote the act of donor registration. Future research should assess whether the module helps increase rates of donor registration within Latinx communities and reduce disparities in access to transplantation.",5,5,Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics

Most of them assume computation on computers. The protocols are difficult for the people who has no knowledge on cryptography. Therefore, secure computation using cards was considered. Since nothing other than the cards are used, the protocols are easy to understand for the people who has no knowledge on cryptography. This paper presents a card-based protocol that generates a random hidden permutation. This problem is applicable to a case when players exchange gifts. The protocol must not output a permutation with a fixed point, which means that every player does not receive the gift he/she prepared. Ishikawa et. al proposed a protocol with two-color cards using random shuffles and a proof of having no fixed points. However, the success probability of the protocol is not so high. Therefore, more efficient random permutation protocol is required. In this paper, we use cyclic shuffles in addition to the random shuffles to lower the possibility of fixed points. We show the success probability of obtaining a permutation without fixed points by our protocol is better than the one by the existing protocol.",22,22,Computer Science; Mathematics

The aims of this study were: 1) to gain insights into the motivations of tobacco use and barriers to smoking cessation among rural village residents; 2) to understand the current tobacco control measures in the rural villages and barriers encountered or perceived for implementation. Methods: Qualitative semi-structured face-to-face interviews and focus group discussions were conducted of 59 rural villagers including 37 village residents, 10 village leaders and 12 village doctors in three counties in Shandong Province, China. Results: Smoking initiation was most often out of curiosity when seeing others smoke, but pressure from cigarette sharing and gifting custom was the major barrier to smoking cessation. The most important reason for quitting successfully was a detrimental health problem. Although many attempted to quit at the advice of other family members, relapses were common and few were able to quit completely and for long-term unless accompanied by significant health issues. Although doctor's advice to quit is effective, many doctors do not offer advice to all patients. There is a lack of true understanding of the harm of smoking and second-hand smoking among the villagers and a lack of access to and knowledge of effective smoking cessation tools among both smokers and village doctors. Tobacco control activities at villages were rare and infrequent. Conclusions: This study highlighted the need to develop tobacco control measures that reflect the unique culture in rural China. Smoking cessation measures are not likely to achieve large scale effect unless the prevailing cigarette sharing and gifting custom is drastically changed. More educations of the hazards of smoking and second-hand smoking to village residents and educations of effective smoking cessation treatment to both village residents and healthcare providers are needed.",29,33,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"

This type of parenting put less focus in understanding children's opinions, feelings and hopes and more in physical and verbal punishment such as spanking, yelling and slapping. This study aims to explore children's perception on their parents' parenting practice with three main objectives, what do their parents do when they do something wrong, what causes their parents to do that and what is their feelings and hopes for their parents. Participants in this study were recruited from 12 kindergartens in Kupang City. Data collection were done in two months using interview session on 26 boys (43%) and 34 girls (56%) aged five to six years old. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Results shown that there are three main reactions from parents when their children made mistake, that is physical punishment, verbal punishment, and permissive punishment. The antecedent of these responses identified are internal factors from the children (e.g. children refuses to eat or sleep) and external factors (e.g. parents under influence of alcohol, conflict between parents). Fathers, mothers and even other caregivers such as grandmothers are identified to be involved in harsh parenting. Children admitted several negative feelings such as feeling sad, alone, afraid and also often expressed their emotions in crying. There are six hopes from children for their parents, they long for physical contact, verbal expression, non verbal expression, spending time together, gifts and also sometimes they want nothing at all. Based on this study, parents in Kupang City could use more knowledge and skills to understand young children and how to discipline them without resorting to harsh parenting practices.",0,0,Education & Educational Research; Family Studies

Little is known about AHPs' role in assisting in FP and PAR decisions. Methods This is a cross-sectional survey of ECHO/ENRICH trainees' attitudes and experience with FP and PAR in AYA with terminal cancer. Results The response rate was 61% (365/601). While 69% felt comfortable discussing FP with terminal AYA after ECHO/ENRICH training, 85% desired further education. The majority (88%) agreed FP should be an option for AYA with cancer, though some agreed offering FP provided false hope (16%) or was a waste of resources (7%). Most shared that avoidance of FP discussions was common practice, especially in the medically fragile, late-stage disease, or among minors. Many attributed lack of conversations to oncology team goals. Only 9% had prior experience with PAR. Many were conflicted about how PAR reproductive material should be gifted and who should be permitted to use PAR. Several raised moral concerns for PAR, or discomfort advising family. Many voiced desire for additional PAR-specific education. Conclusion ECHO/ENRICH trainees had varied levels of exposure to FP in terminal AYA and limited experiences with PAR. Many expressed uncertainties with PAR, which may be alleviated with further training and transparent institutional policies.",1,1,Oncology

A sample of 641 Dutch-speaking adolescents from 11 to 15 years old, 363 girls and 278 boys, participated in this study. Results showed that a model without cross-loadings did not fit the data well (using confirmatory factor analysis), whereas a factor model in which all cross-loadings were included yielded fit statistics that were in support of the factorial structure of the OEQ-II scores (using exploratory structural equation modeling). Furthermore, our findings supported the assumption of (partial) strict measurement invariance of the OEQ-II scores across intelligence levels and across gender. Such levels of measurement invariance allow valid comparisons between factor means and factor relationships across groups. In particular, the gifted group scored significantly higher on intellectual and sensual overexcitability (OE) than the nongifted group, girls scored higher on emotional and sensual OE than boys, and boys scored higher on intellectual and psychomotor OE than girls.",20,22,Psychology

Support programs can improve well-being, but they first require identifying who are the households that judge their income is insufficient to meet their basic needs, and what factors are associated with subjective poverty. Design/methodology/approach Households report the income level they judge is sufficient to make ends meet. Then, they are classified as being subjectively poor if their own monetary income is inferior to the level they indicated. Second, the study compares the performance of three machine learning algorithms, the random forest, support vector machines and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression, applied to a set of socioeconomic variables to predict subjective poverty status. Findings The random forest generates 85.29% of correct predictions using a range of income and non-income predictors, closely followed by the other two techniques. For the middle-income group, the LASSO regression outperforms random forest. Subjective poverty is mostly associated with monetary income for low-income households. However, a combination of low income, low endowment (land, consumption assets) and unusual large expenditure (medical, gifts) constitutes the key predictors of feeling poor for the middle-income households. Practical implications To reduce the feeling of poverty, policy intervention should continue to focus on increasing incomes. However, improvements in nonincome domains such as health expenditure, education and family demographics can also relieve the feeling of income inadequacy. Methodologically, better performance of either algorithm depends on the data at hand. Originality/value For the first time, the authors show that prediction techniques are reliable to identify subjective poverty prevalence, with example from rural China. The analysis offers specific attention to the modest-income households, who may feel poor but not be identified as such by objective poverty lines, and is relevant when policy-makers seek to address the next step after ending extreme poverty. Prediction performance and mechanisms for three machine learning algorithms are compared.",3,3,Agriculture; Business & Economics

Females of this cave-dwelling insect are characterized by a conspicuous penis-like intromittent organ, termed a gynosome, which is inserted into the vagina-like male genitalia during copulation. Another evolutionarily novel structure, the spermathecal plate, enables a female to simultaneously store two freshly deposited spermatophores (consisting of sperm and possibly nutritious substances) in her sperm storage organ (spermatheca). It is unknown whether the two spermatophores are derived from two different males. To investigate the mating ecology and population genetic structures of these insects with sex-reversed genitalia, 16 novel highly polymorphic microsatellite loci were isolated and characterized based on similar to 2,275 Mbp genomic sequences from an undescribed Neotrogla species. Our first screening detected 99,888 candidate loci. Similar to other hemipteroid insects studied thus far, AAT motif microsatellites were conspicuously dominant. We further screened 99 sequences, for which 50 pairs of polymerase chain reaction primers were successfully designed. Sixteen of these primers successfully amplified products of the expected size in the 11 Neotrogla sp. individuals collected from two caves. The number of alleles per loci varied from two to nine, with no significant deviation from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in either population. Although the caves sampled were only approximately 1 km apart, significant genetic differentiation was detected between the two populations. In total, 13, 12, 13 and 11 loci were cross-amplified in N. aurora, N. brasiliensis, N. curvata and N. truncata, respectively, indicating the applicability of these microsatellite loci for metapopulation genetic studies in multiple Neotrogla species.",5,6,Entomology

In the present study, we used data from the World Bank (1995-2014) to analyze the environmental effects of tourism in Pakistan. The parameters used in the present study were the number of tourist arrival, energy use, gross domestic product and CO2 emissions. The data was analyzed using Vector Error Correction Model, and Granger Causality Test. The results of the study showed that no parameters have a significant effect on CO2 emissions in the long-term. The number of tourist arrival has declined in recent years due to socio-political conditions in the country.

This type of perception must be made with little information, very often based solely on facial cues. Although people are capable of accurately predicting others' preferences from facial cues, we do not yet know how such inferences are made by crossmodal correspondence (arbitrary sensory associations) between facial cues and inferred attributes. The crossmodal correspondence literature implies the existence of sensory associations between shapes and tastes, and people consistently match roundness and angularity to sweet and sour foods, respectively. Given that peoples' faces have dimensions characterized by roundness and angularity, it may be plausible that people infer others' preferences by relying on the correspondence between facial roundness and taste. Based on a crossmodal correspondence framework, this study aimed to reveal the role of shape-taste correspondences in social perception. We investigated whether Japanese participants infer others' taste (sweet/sour) preferences based on facial shapes (roundness/angularity). The results showed that participants reliably inferred that round-faced (vs. angular-faced) individuals preferred sweet foods (Study 1). Round-faced individuals and sweet foods were well matched, and the matching mediated the inference of other person's preferences (Study 2). An association between facial roundness and inference of sweet taste preferences was observed in more natural faces, and perceived obesity mediated this association (Study 3). These findings advance the applicability of crossmodal correspondences in social perception, and imply the pervasiveness of prejudicial bias in the marketplace.",8,8,Food Science & Technology

RESULTS Of 1 536 482 children born in Florida from singleton births from 1994 to 2002 with complete demographic information, 787 105 (51.2%) were male; 338 894 (22.1%) of mothers were black and 999 684 (65.1%) were married at time of birth, and the mean (SD) age for mothers at time of birth was 27.2 (6.2) years. Late-term infants had 0.7% of an SD (95% CI, 0.001-0.013; P =.02) higher average test scores in elementary and middle school, 2.8% (95% CI, 0.4-5.2; P =.02) higher probability of being gifted, and 3.1% (95% CI, 0.0-6.1; P =.05) reduced probability of poor cognitive outcomes compared with full-term infants. These cognitive benefits appeared strongest for children with disadvantaged family background characteristics. Late-term infants were also 2.1% (95% CI, -0.3 to 4.5; P =.08) more likely to be physically impaired. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE There appears to be a tradeoff between cognitive and physical outcomes associated with late-term gestation. Children born late-term performed better on 3 measures of school-based cognitive functioning but worse on 1 measure of physical functioning relative to children born full term. Our findings provide longer-run information for expectant parents and physicians who are considering delivery at full term vs late term. These findings are most relevant to uncomplicated, low-risk pregnancies.",16,16,Pediatrics

Multivariate analysis revealed a positive association between task orientation and intrinsic motivation, the belief that success in sport is achieved through hard work, and self-improvement-based purposes of sport. In contrast, ego orientation was associated with the belief that success in sport is achieved by those who are gifted with natural ability and who know how to maximize external and deceptive Factors. Further, ego orientation was linked to the belief that the purpose of sport was for personal gain.

We argue that a long-term perspective reflective of wealth's cumulative nature is crucial to understand the extent and channels of wealth reproduction across generations. Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics that span nearly half a century, we show that a one-decile increase in parents' wealth position is associated with an increase of about four percentiles in their offspring's wealth position in adulthood. We show that grandparental wealth is a unique predictor of grandchildren's wealth, above and beyond the role of parental wealth, suggesting that a focus on only parent-child dyads understates the importance of family wealth lineages. Second, considering five channels of wealth transmission-gifts and bequests, education, marriage, homeownership, and business ownership-we find that most of the advantages arising from family wealth begin much earlier in the life course than the common focus on bequests implies, even when we consider the wealth of grandparents. We also document the stark disadvantage of African American households in terms of not only their wealth attainment but also their intergenerational wealth mobility compared to whites.",91,91,Sociology

Based upon this being-in-the-world, understanding in its everyday life, proximally and for the most part, does not know the distinction between cognitive subject and cognized objects. An understanding in Heideggerian sense is not necessarily explicit, definite, specific, or thematic. One determines the nature of entities in their Being without necessarily having the explicit concept of the meaning (understanding; added) of Being at one's disposal.

Customer satisfaction is the key factor for a successful tourism factory. Besides, customer satisfaction is highly dependent on the behaviors of the front-line service providers. In this study, a case of Brand's Health Museum is chosen to examine how the behaviors of the front-line service providers affect the customers' perceptions in service quality by internal customer survey. One-way analysis of variance and independent sample t-test are applied to identify which demographic variable(s) might have greater impact on service process satisfaction.

Kleber,,"Historians have written quite a lot about the fact that, starting in 1798 with his Egyptian campaign, Napoleon Bonaparte took everything necessary with him to acquaint the Egyptians with the advanced achievements of the European civilization. However, historiography quite rarely mentions that Napoleon brought another gift to the Middle East in the form of revolutionary terror. Out of all the achievements of revolutionary France, it was terror that was most actively used there. Having realised that neither praises of Prophet Muhammad nor anti-Mamluk discourse provided the French with sympathies of the Muslims of Egypt, Bonaparte used la terreur, which did not stop for a day during the entire period of occupation. The policy of intimidation of the population by the occupants was systematic, although it was combined with various ostentatious gestures of the commander-in-chief designed to win the sympathy of the Muslim elite. There was a kind of division of responsibilities: Bonaparte tried to charm the influential sheikhs of the al-Azhar mosque, invited them to dinners, conversed with them about Islam, and gave them gifts; at the same time, the police made up by local Christians and Maghreb mercenaries day after day terrorised the inhabitants of Cairo and its environs, arbitrarily killing innocent people to intimidate everyone else. With the departure of Bonaparte from Egypt, when Kleber took charge of the Oriental army, terror did not stop, but only changed its character from permanent to situational. Following Kleber's death, his successor, General Menou once again gave terror a permanent nature. It was the policy of terror that allowed a tiny minority of thirty thousand people to hold power over several million people in a country almost twice the size of France for three years.",1,1,Arts & Humanities - Other Topics

Inquiry-based laboratory experiences in the course were slowly converted during this time from partly student centered and mostly teacher led to completely student centered beginning in fall 2008. Quarterly analysis of the effect of increased inquiry upon average weekly report submissions of 400 students over 4 yr showed a significant improvement in submission (P < 0.0002) between quarters 1 and 2 and also improvement from year to year between the academic years of 2006/2007 and 2009/2010 (P < 0.0001). A comparison of student test score percentages from 346 students in 4 major tests showed a significant increase (P = 0.0125) beginning in the academic year of 2008/2009, when the conversion of all laboratories in the course from partly student centered to completely student centered was concluded compared with scores over the 2 yr from 2006/2007 up to this point. There was also a significant difference (P < 00001) in test score percentages between the individual tests themselves over the 4 yr studied. Taking the study a step further, the 35 students registered in the two PAD classes offered in the fall 2010 semester were divided in each of their classes into student-centered and teacher-centered groups, with the former designing all their experiments and the latter following instructions from the teacher. Student score percentages on specific test questions from the four major tests that focused on transfer of student understanding were compared between these two groups. There was a significant improvement (P = 0.012) when students designed their own laboratories (student-centered group) compared with doing what the teacher asked (teacher-centered group). There was also a significant difference between these student score percentages among the individual tests (P < 0.0001).

In Summa Theologiae, the issue is placed in the context of justice and injustice; thus, this article seeks to show the deeper reason as well as the possible connections between religio and iustitia. Justice, according to Thomas, is preferably realised where there are differences among people and some debt (debitum) occurs that needs to be settled. The inclusion of the virtue of religio under justice is justified by the existence of a relationship in which a debitum also arises, but settlement is impossible. Aristotle, who inspired Thomas, claims that true friendship rests on similarity and equality. This article wants to present how this opinion of Aristotle could be manifested in Thomas's description of the virtue of religio. The article posits the question of whether the gift of friendship with God does not permit us to give a new interpretation of the virtue of religio. The authors conclude that, together with love, the virtue of religio is infused into man, thanks to which he can perform deeds commensurate with the goal of ultimate beatitude. For a person who loves God, the act of religio is not only a means of satisfying the demand of justice towards the Creator of all things but also a grace in which he returns his love to God.",0,0,Religion

Using a critical content analysis approach, three relevant constructs were identified with depictions including savant/super-crip, non-human othering, and psycho-emotional disablism. Each of these areas is discussed related to the current literature on disability, generally, and autism, more specifically. This analysis demonstrates that cultural understandings of disability are dominated by the medical model, and continue to stigmatize and pathologize while excluding positive social identities. Consideration of the potential damaging aspects of literature portrayals of autism in fictional works is needed to move the autism genre forward in a humanizing and inclusive manner. Points of interest This study brings awareness to some assumptions around disability by pulling apart one way that autism is presented for public understanding.

We estimated the size of the wealth gap between each immigrant population and natives, the sources of the gap, and the trajectory of wealth convergence. The data revealed that the mean net worth of native-born groups was higher than that of all immigrant sub-groups. The gap was widest for non-European immigrants and lowest for West, Central, and South European immigrants. Differences in the rate of homeownership accounted for the largest portion of the gap, while neither differential levels of income nor education accounted for much of the gap between native-born and either non -European immigrants or immigrants from post-communist countries. Reception of gifts or inheritances did not account for a meaningful portion of the gaps. Estimation of the rate of convergence suggests that it would take an average of 85 years after arrival for an average immigrant household to bridge the wealth gap between it and an average native-born household.

Different psychological models aim to describe and explain achievement and its development in different domains. However, there remains a need for a framework that guides empirical research within and across different domains. With the talent-development-in-achievement-domains (TAD) framework, we provide a general talent-development framework applicable to a wide range of achievement domains. The overarching aim of this framework is to support empirical research by focusing on measurable psychological constructs and their meaning at different levels of talent development. Furthermore, the TAD framework can be used for constructing domain-specific talent-development models. With examples for the application of the TAD framework to the domains of mathematics, music, and visual arts, the review provided supports the suitability of the TAD framework for domain-specific model construction and indicates numerous research gaps and open questions that should be addressed in future research.",26,26,Psychology
1481,2017,"Meschede, T; Taylor, J; Mann, A; Shapiro, T",Family Achievements?: How a College Degree Accumulates Wealth for Whites and Not For Blacks,FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF ST LOUIS REVIEW,,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE; RACE,"A college education has been linked to higher life-time earnings and better economic achievements, so the expectation would be that it is also linked to higher net wealth for everybody. However, recent analyses challenge this hypothesis and find that the expectation holds true for White college-educated households but not for Black college-educated households. To examine this finding further and investigate the role of family financial transfers in household net wealth, the authors perform a mixed-method study using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics for a 24-year period, 1989-2013, and qualitative data from the Institute on Assets and Social Policy Levering Mobility study. Their results confirm that White college-educated households amass wealth, whereas the wealth of their Black counterparts declines. The authors also estimate the impact of just inheritance or large financial gifts and find that they decrease the existing racial wealth gap by nearly $ 40,000, or 20 percent. Further analyses demonstrate that White college graduates are significantly and substantially more likely to provide and receive financial support for education and/ or a home purchase, while Black college graduates are significantly more likely to financially support their parents. Multivariate regression analysis identifies receipt of financial support for education and a home purchase as a positive contributor to net wealth and financial help for parents as a negative contributor to net wealth, disadvantaging Black college-educated households, who are less likely to receive and more likely to give financial support. Longitudinal interview data collected in the Institute on Assets and Social Policy Leveraging Mobility study illustrate the mechanisms of family financial transfers and their relationship to wealth accumulation, contrasting the White and Black households' experiences. The discussion underscores the need to better understand intergenerational wealth and wealth sharing within families when studying wealth outcomes and highlights the role of family financial wealth transfers in creating opportunities for those who benefit the most-mostly White college-educated households.",19,19,Business & Economics

Design/methodology/approach This study has used a nationally representative sample of 21,662 older adults (aged 60 and above) from the Longitudinal Ageing Study of India data of 2017-2018. Intra-household decision-making participation is measured based on decision-making activities that includes marriage of daughter/son, buying and selling of property, giving a gift to the family, education of family member and arrangement of social/religious events. This paper used bivariate analysis and binary logistic regression model to examine the factors associated with the participation of older adults in the intra-household decision-making activities. Findings The result has shown that older persons' participation declined with increased age. This study has also found a difference in the participation of intra-households decision-making activities between male and female, rural and urban older adults, poor and rich older adults. Older adults with good health status who maintain social engagement and a good lifestyle are more likely to participate in the household's decision-making activities. Practical implications Older adults with better economic and social status are more likely to participate in intra-household decision-making activities that make their life happier than the counterpart. Therefore, emphasis should be given to those vulnerable older adults who do not have any social and economic security in the society. Originality/value There are limited studies available on intra-household decision-making participation by older adults.

To inform such DV primary prevention strategies for this population, we herein aimed to identify correlates of DV experience in early marriage. Utilizing a cross-sectional design, potential correlates of DV experience were explored among a geographically-clustered random sample of 100 recently-married women residing in slums in Pune, India. In multivariable regression, DV experience was associated with less educational attainment by the participant's spouse (standardized beta=-0.281, p=0.004), less satisfaction of the spouse's family with the maanpaan (wedding-related gifts provided by the bride's family) they received at the time of marriage (standardized beta=-0.298, p<0.001), poorer conflict negotiation skills (standardized beta=-0.308, p<0.001), and greater acknowledgement of DV occurrence in family and friends (standardized beta=0.436, p<0.001). These correlates suggest strategies that could be incorporated into future DV primary prevention interventions for this vulnerable population (i.e. promoting completion of formal education of boys alongside girls, mitigating causes of familial dowry harassment, improving conflict negotiation skills, and challenging norms surrounding DV).",15,15,Science & Technology - Other Topics

Though a relatively cheap animal source food, under-two years aged Ethiopian children rarely eat egg. This study tested effects of a child-owned poultry intervention integrated with nutrition education on egg intake. Targeting 6-18 months children, the trial was conducted in Southern Ethiopia from May to November 2018. Clusters were randomly selected and allocated to intervention and control arms. Children in the intervention group (N = 127) received two egg-laying local hens and caging materials in a cultural and religious gifting ceremony. Parents promised to not sell nor share the chickens and eggs, present two more hens, replace those that died, and feed all eggs produced to the chickenowner child on the basis of one-egg-a-day. Cage utilization, proper poultry husbandry and environmental sanitation, as well as egg feeding, were promoted. Controls (N = 126) received the regular community-based nutrition and agriculture education. Child-owned poultry increased significantly in intervention (p < 0.001) (beta = 3.856; 95% CI of 3.553-4.159). Egg intake was 72% vs 20.7% among intervention and control children, respectively, at end line (p < 0.001; Odds ratio = 3.841; 95% CI = 2.640-5.589). Mean eggs [SD] consumed by the week before end line significantly increased in intervention (4.85 [2.41]) compared to control (0.4 [0.61]) (p < 0.001; beta = 2.202; 95% CI = 1.971-2.433) children. Child-owned hen flock size was strongly associated with egg intake (r = 0.975; p < 0.001). Nearly one-third of children in intervention met the minimum dietary diversity (p = 0.016; Odds ratio = 1.857; 95% CI = 1.120-3.078). Vitamin-A rich fruits and vegetables consumption (p = 0.027) increased in intervention, as a result of sales of excess eggs. Enabling children to be owners of chickens together with nutrition education significantly increased chicken production and egg consumption. We recommend integration of child-owned poultry into ongoing malnutrition prevention activities particularly in resource-poor settings where undernutrition is high and animal source food intake is low.",1,1,Agriculture; Food Science & Technology

This study aims to compare European students' perceived Chinese cultural values with those of Taiwanese students and to provide a deeper understanding of the cultural and social interactions of European students in Taiwan. A personal survey and in-depth interviews were administered in five major universities in northern, central, and southern part of Taiwan to obtain both quantitative and qualitative data. European students consider few Chinese cultural values like knowledge, kindness, tolerance of others, and harmony with others higher than those of local Taiwanese students. In few traditional Chinese cultural values like gift giving, courtesy, prudence, Taiwanese students value them with higher scores than European students do. With reference to the Chinese culture in particular, European students have to deal with different teaching styles and different norms while communicating with instructors and local students in Taiwan. Five themes were formalized to describe European students' experiences in Taiwan focusing on lifestyles, acculturative stress, learning, language issues, and social interactions with local people. The learning adaptation, individually distinctive, converges to positive experiences through socio-cultural interactions, which makes the experiences valuable and precious. European students do not overlook European ways of engaging with instructors, but they perceived, internalized and demonstrated their learning process in Taiwanese higher education.

Among them, divergent thinking (DT) has long been considered a key ingredient of creativity and an essential criterion for predicting real-life creative outcomes. However, the link between DT and creative achievement (CA) has yielded heterogeneous results, as outlined by a prior meta-analysis on the DT-CA link published in 2008. Given several limitations of this meta-analysis and the large body of relevant studies that have been published since then, the present article aimed to offer an updated and methodologically rigorous meta-analytical examination of the DT-CA link. A total of 766 effect sizes from 70 studies encompassing 14,901 subjects were analyzed using a meta-analytic three-level model. The results showed that DT was positively, albeit weakly, linked to CA, with only 3% of shared variance. Moderator analyses indicated that this link was robust to variations in DT and CA measures used, gender, educational level, measurement interval between DT and CA, and country of study, but differed by DT task modality, CA domain, and intellectual giftedness. Specifically, the strength of the DT-CA link was significantly larger for (a) verbal DT tasks, (b) CA in the performance domain, and (c) gifted subjects. A significant interaction effect was also found between CA domain and intellectual giftedness, with the DT-CA link being strongest among gifted subjects in the performance domain. Implications of these results for the study and measurement of creativity are discussed.",11,11,Arts & Humanities - Other Topics; Psychology

There is a gap in the latest research regarding nurses' experiences of compassion fatigue. Little is known about how compassion fatigue affects the nurse as a person, and indications of how it affects the profession are scarce. Aim: The aim of this study was to explore compassion fatigue experienced by nurses and how it affects them as persons and professionals. Research design, participants, and research context: A qualitative explorative approach was used. The data consisted of texts from interviews with seven nurses in various nursing contexts. Content analysis was used. Ethical consideration: Ethical approval was sought and granted from an ethics committee at the university where the researchers were based, and written, informed consent was obtained from all the participants. Findings: Five themes were discovered: Compassion as an empathic gift and compassion fatigue as a result of compassion overload, Compassion fatigue as exhausting the nurse as a professional and private person, Compassion fatigue as a crisis with potentially valuable insights, Compassion fatigue can be handled by self-care and focus on self, and Compassion fatigue is affected by life itself and multifaceted factors. Discussion: Compassion stress and overload can lead to compassion fatigue. Compassion fatigue affects the nurse's ability to compassion, and the caring is no longer experienced in the same way; the nurses experienced it as being deprived of the gift of compassion. Compassion fatigue implicates a crisis with potentially valuable insights. Conclusion: Compassion fatigue can be symbolized as bruises in the soul, hurtful, but with time it can fade away, although it leaves a sense of caution within the nurse, which can affect the suffering patient.",8,9,Social Sciences - Other Topics; Nursing

Of particular concern is the finding that rural students attend post-secondary schools at lower rates than their urban counterparts, and when they do attend, they are less likely to graduate from STEM programs. One reason may be that they are not prepared for advanced STEM coursework because they lack access to essential STEM talent-development programs in middle or high school. This creates excellence gaps, which exacerbate the narrowing STEM pipeline to the workforce. To address this, we formed a university-school partnership to develop an outside-of-school STEM talent development program, called STEM Excellence, for rural middle-school students who attend under-resourced schools. The aim of STEM Excellence was to increase students' achievement and aspirations while empowering their teachers to develop local STEM programs grounded in developmental psychology theories.

The moderating effect of demographic changes (i.e., the number of instances of hukou migration) on social capital and farmers' willingness to adopt new agricultural technology was further investigated. The results show that the following: (1) Social trust has a significant positive impact on farmers' willingness to adopt new agricultural technologies, while social participation has no significant impact on farmers' willingness to adopt new technologies. (2) Social networks influence farmers' technology adoption behavior differently, e.g., the scope of relatives' wedding gifts has a significant and positive influence on farmers' technology adoption behavior, while the scope of non-relatives' wedding gifts has no significant influence on farmers' technology adoption behavior. (3) Demographic change plays a moderating role in the impact of social capital on farmers' willingness to adopt new agricultural technologies. In other words, the greater the number of instances of hukou migration, the less the promoting effect of social capital on farmers' willingness to adopt agricultural technology. (4) In the eastern and central regions of China, social capital has a significant positive impact on farmers' adoption of new agricultural technologies. In the western region of China, social capital has a significant negative impact on farmers' adoption of new agricultural technology. In the northeast region of China, social capital has no significant impact on farmers' adoption of new agricultural technologies.

Methods: This randomized controlled trial evaluated whether a patient education intervention enhanced with positive-affect induction and self-affirmation (PA) was more effective than patient education (PE) alone in improving medication adherence and BP reduction among 256 hypertensive African Americans followed up in 2 primary care practices. Patients in both groups received a culturally tailored hypertension self-management workbook, a behavioral contract, and bimonthly telephone calls designed to help them overcome barriers to medication adherence. Also, patients in the PA group received small gifts and bimonthly telephone calls to help them incorporate positive thoughts into their daily routine and foster self-affirmation. The main outcome measures were medication adherence (assessed with electronic pill monitors) and within-patient change in BP from baseline to 12 months. Results: The baseline characteristics were similar in both groups: the mean BP was 137/82 mm Hg; 36% of the patients had diabetes; 11% had stroke; and 3% had chronic kidney disease. Based on the intention-to-treat principle, medication adherence at 12 months was higher in the PA group than in the PE group (42% vs 36%, respectively; P = .049).

The authors investigated the relationship between manifestations of a certain type of giftedness in children and their interest in a certain group of professions. The assessment of manifestations of giftedness was conducted based on a methodology developed by A.I. Savenkov. This methodology helps assess the presence of traits of the following 10 major types of giftedness: intellectual, creative, academic, pictorial, musical, literary, performing, technical, leadership, and sporting. The study of interest in professions was conducted based on E.A. Klimov's Differential-Diagnostic Questionnaire, which had been adapted for preschoolers. The study helped draw the following conclusions: (1) based on pedagogue and parent reports, the type of giftedness that is detected most often in senior preschoolers is the pictorial type, followed by sporting giftedness, and then leadership giftedness; (2) parent assessments of manifestations of giftedness in their children tend to be significantly higher than teacher assessments when it comes to pictorial, musical, literary, leadership, and sporting giftedness; (3) the number of preschoolers with multiple manifestations of giftedness (a high level on three or more types) is significantly larger than the number of preschoolers with manifestations of one-to-two types of giftedness; (4) gifted children tend to have a clear-cut interest in a certain group of professions; (5) there is a significant correlation (at the 0.01 level based on the Pearson correlation coefficient) between leadership giftedness (teacher assessments) and interest in professions within the 'Man - Man' group, between academic giftedness (teacher assessments) and interest in the 'Man - Technology' group of professions, and between creative giftedness (parent assessments) and interest in the 'Man - Technology' group of professions.

For the purpose of this article, I have assessed from obituaries the average lifespan of the clergy (ministers) in the Methodist Church of South Africa (MCSA), who died between 2003 and 2014. These obituaries were published in the Yearbooks of the MCSA from 2004 to 2015. I also give attention to how the deceased ministers are remembered. The average lifespan of Methodist ministers is 72 years, and it is likely to increase to 74 years by 2023. This article discusses the implications of Methodist ministers' average lifespan and suggests that the clergy should be encouraged and enabled to retire at the age of 60 years. The following 12 themes (or missional lessons), mainly answering the question of how the clergy are remembered, emerged from the qualitative analysis of obituaries: they were gifted preachers of the gospel of Jesus Christ; they lived a balanced life; they were humble servants in Jesus' vineyard; they were sensitive storytellers with a deep sense of humour; they were community builders; they were leaders and meticulous in administration; they were prayer warriors; they loved and valued education; they were disciplined and principled; they enjoyed music; they worked hard for an everlasting peace on earth; and they were zealous stewards of God's creation.",1,1,Religion

Human behavior related to money cannot be separated from mental accounting contained inside that person. Mental accounting frequently makes the human behavior become irrational and incompatible with the existing economic theory such as expected utility theory and fungible theory. Mental accounting is the human way of thinking, assumed that in the human brain there are barriers that would separate the events related to the money into the accounts of income, spending, and saving. The way of thinking in this decision making is certainly influenced also by background knowledge and life-story obtained by humans during their lifetime. Accountant knowledge about accounting is surely different from persons who have never known or studied accounting at all (non-accountants). This study aims to observe the mental accounting of consumers, particularly the mental accounting between consumers with accounting educational background (accountants) and non-accounting educational background (non-accountants), which affects the behavior of decision making under conditions that there are discount coupons in online shops. This was a survey quantitative research with the samples of online shop customers redeeming the discount coupons by random sampling based on Computerized Grocery-Shopping Simulation.

Previous studies have reported that 'white' oocytes in the ovarian tissue of tilapia continue to develop to maturity during the next spawning period. To test this hypothesis we use hematoxylin-eosin staining, terminal deoxynucleotidyl nick-end labeling, and electron microscopy to analyze development of 'white' oocytes in genetically improved farmed tilapia (GIFT: Oreochromis niloticus) females over time (1, 7, 13, 19, and 25 days) during one reproductive cycle, and real-time PCR to identify expression of autophagyand apoptosis-related genes in gonad tissue. Only some of these 'white' oocytes developed to maturity and discharge, while many underwent atresia during development. Atretic follicles were detected at various stages of oocyte development, and the number of 'white' oocytes continued to increase during the reproductive cycle. On days 19 and 25 during one reproductive cycle, many apoptotic granulosa cells were distributed around stage IV and V oocytes; the integrity of granulosa cells was poor, organelles were deformed and ruptured, and the number of autophagic lysosomes was significantly increased. We detect increased transcript levels of Caspase-3 and Becline-1 and a reduced Bcl-2/Bax ratio in ovarian tissues on day 25 of culture. Our results show that autophagy and apoptosis of granulosa cells participate in the atresia of GIFT follicles.

The BVO was formulated using olive oil (15%), sunflower oil (15%), linseed oil (30%) and refined, bleached, deodorized palm olein (40%) to mimic the major fatty acid classes of FO. In general, no significant effect (P>0.05) of tilapia genotype or lipid source on fatty acid digestibility was observed. The fatty acid composition of tilapia whole-body, irrespective of genotype, was significantly (P<0.05) affected by the dietary lipid source, but interestingly, tilapia fed the BVO diet which contained no polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) longer than C18, recorded significant amounts of both n-6 and n-3 long chain (LC)-PUFA. The present study clearly indicated that tilapia farming can be a net producer of n-3 LC-PUFA. Using the whole-body fatty acid balance method, total fatty acid beta-oxidation, Delta-5 and Delta-6 desaturation were observed to be significantly higher in fish fed the BVO diet compared to fish on the FO diet. No apparent Delta-5 desaturase activity on n-3 PUFA was observed in fish fed the FO diet. Both dietary lipid source and tilapia genotype elicited significant effects on the elongase activity on 18:4n-3, 18:2n-6 and 18:3n-6. Tilapia fed the BVO diet exhibited efficient bioconversion of 18:2n-6 to n-6 LC-PUFA indicating that the fatty acid metabolism of tilapia is able to fully compensate for the lack of dietary n-6 LC-PUFA when fed a vegetable oil-based diet. All fish showed active liponeogenesis suggesting that the addition of higher dietary levels of SFA and MUFA may be beneficial to tilapia. Irrespective of diet, GIFT tilapia showed higher rates of fatty acid neogenesis along with higher rates of elongation, Delta-5 and Delta-6 desaturation of both the n-6 PUFA and n-3 PUFA.

There are multiple synergistic effects among APS, NaOH and cellulose raw materials on promoting the decomposition of APS to form a large amount of SO4-, which can hydrolyze a disordered region and thus release the crystalline part of cellulose sources. Of particular note, with the addition of NaOH solid granules rather than solution, the dissolution heat of NaOH can be efficiently utilized to accelerate the preparation process, thereby reducing the energy consumption in the process of CNC isolation.

In Turkey, as in much of the world, men dominate ownership of property. This is despite the fact that women have had equal rights to own and inherit property since 1926. With the establishment of the Republic in 1923 came a series of reforms, one of which replaced Islamic Sharia law with a secular civil law that was based on the Swiss Civil Code. The new law, among other things, guaranteed equal rights of property and inheritance regardless of gender. In an attempt to understand the tangled relationship between property and women's empowerment, we conducted interviews regarding inheritance practices among ideologically secular, wealthy women in Istanbul. For these women and their families, the logic of wealth distribution is deeply informed by a commitment to equality between children with little regard for gender. Even in those cases where strict equality in terms of sameness was not employed, the goal was for an overall balance and fairness between recipients. Despite the fact that inheritance law provides for equality, most of the families employed interuivos transfer; gifts among the living, to distribute their family wealth. Perhaps most interesting, and in contrast to the literature, is the fact that these women do not express any sense of empowerment derived from their status as property owners.

In many taxa, bimodal distributions of copulation and/or intromission duration are known to be the result of adaptation to sperm competition risk avoidance. However, the stalk-eyed seed bug, Chauliops fallax Scott (Heteroptera: Malcidae), exhibits completely different mating behaviour to other known examples. The male mounts the female and then inserts his aedeagus repeatedly and intermittently until the termination of copulation. Insertion duration exhibited a bimodal distribution with two peaks: a short insertion within 6 min which occurred one to three times without insemination, followed by long insertions of approximately 30 min with repeated insemination. To examine the adaptive significance of the two types of genital insertion, we investigated whether the amount of sperm transferred, female remating receptivity, number of eggs laid, hatchability and female longevity differed between the two insertion types. Sperm transfer mainly occurred during long insertions but very little occurred during short insertions. Similarly, long insertions induced mated females to resist subsequent mating attempts of other males but short insertions did not. Short insertions did not affect the number of eggs laid, hatchability or female longevity. Although our results showed that C. fallax males transferred sperm to females and inhibited female remating with long insertions, we currently cannot explain the adaptive function of short insertions without insemination.

Findings In total, 614 doctors and 1184 inpatients on discharge from the surgical and internal medicine units of the two hospitals participated in the survey yielding 90% response rates. The study confirmed the variation amongst doctors in demonstrating their professionalism in terms of respecting patients' views and preferences when determining diagnostic procedures and treatment plans, and when making ethical decisions. Although 90% patients indicated that they showed respects to doctors, close to 20% of the doctors disagreed that they received high respect from patients. About 12% of doctors prescribed unnecessary diagnostic procedures to patient for the purpose of generating profit and more than 20% of patients indicated that they gave gifts to doctors in order to receive better treatment. Conclusions Although about 80% of doctors demonstrated certain aspects of professionalism required by practitioners, the inconsistency across the medical workforce may exacerbate tense doctor-patient relationships. A review of medical curricula and focus of the internship program is required in order to assist medical graduates with forming required professional identity in order to improve patient satisfaction and better clinical outcomes. To be effective, a more systematic approach is recommended.",6,6,Education & Educational Research

The aim of this work is to introduce into scientific discourse rare archival documents on the history of Russian linguistics, and also to study linguistic polemics in the USSR in the era of the onslaught of the Marrism of the end of the 1940s. The main methods of studying the material are historical-linguistic, lexicographic, sociolinguistic and linguistic source analysis (search, decoding and commenting on archival texts). In the course of the research of documentary materials, the author has revealed new facts testifying to the change of a vector of scientific views on explanatory lexicography as a whole which, unlike the previous dictionary projects, was not adapted to academic needs, and first of all solved practical problems of explaining the actual lexicon of the 20th century. The article notes that one of the key issues of the dictionary work of that time was the interpretation of Sovietisms, on the one hand, and religious words and expressions, on the other. The archaic vocabulary (merchant and church elements) became the object of fierce criticism of Ozhegov's opponents. Scholars and non-philological readers, polemicizing with Ozhegov, paid special attention to reviews and analysis of semantic, stylistic and cultural-historical realities of dictionary entries. Ozhegov's respondents also discussed the difficult fate of the dictionary. The published letters contain semi-official reviews from both famous scholars (A.P. Evgenieva, Ya.M. Endzelin, R.R. Gel'gardt, J.V. Loja) and ordinary readers of The Dictionary, they reveal Ozhegov as a person of special gift loving his native language. These letters provide valuable material for the analysis of linguistic homeland studies of the period of struggle between the two ideologies in science. The letters reveal new facts of Ozhegov's editorial work, discuss the criticism of the publication in the press, note its strengths and weaknesses. The article emphasizes the sociocultural aspect of Ozhegov's interpretations and the ambiguity of their perception by contemporaries. The Dictionary is included in the context of general linguistic ideas by D.N. Ushakov and L.V. Shcherba. The high pedagogical value of this source is indicated. The published archival materials confirm a unique fact in the scientific practice of the mid-20th century: the emergence of a popular explanatory dictionary reflecting the cultural constants of the time and serving as a reliable tool for self-education. The article is of interest to historiographers of science, lexicologists and lexicographers, linguaculturologists, sociolinguists.",0,0,Linguistics

(Veena & Shailaja, 2013) Psychological studies refer to significant differences in student motivation and to the resulting differences in the learning process. Each mental process has its individual development with a particular individual. Therefore, gifted pupils learn fast and better, they achieve the expected results sooner than less talented pupils. The proper motivation for learning, the environment in which a child grows, and the heredity factor also play an important role. Synchronizing individual motives of students with factors that affect the entire society leads educators to their better knowledge and to an adequate stimulation that can fulfill their personal ambitions and social goals. This aspect requires the teacher to have a high degree of professionalism and pedagogical mastery. In the case of teaching process, the teacher is expected to be able to combine the adopted theoretical knowledge with practice, which is not insignificant for students, but on the other hand, it corresponds with their motives.",0,0,Business & Economics; International Relations

The goal of this study is to investigate the motivational structure of participants of Chemistry Olympiad summer camps. The participants are young students who achieved the best results in chemistry olympiads. Chemistry is one of the least popular subjects among Czech students and therefore it is important to understand what motivates extraordinary, or gifted students, to learn. Methods. Participants (N=38) completed a combination of qualitative and/or quantitative questionnaires. The primary questionnaire, known as the Motivational Induction Method (MIM), is a quality-quantitative questionnaire that uses the principle of open-ended questions. This method can provide a deep understanding of participants' plans, desires and wishes but also fears, inhibitions or problems. Other questionnaires used were: The Learning Motivation questionnaire and the Achievement Motivation questionnaire which measure the sources of motivation and proportion of achievement needs, respectively. Result. The MIM questionnaire, providing qualitative-quantitative analysis, showed that participants' motivation was mainly focused on self (identity) and contact with others (social motivation). The Learning Motivation questionnaires revealed that the two most important motivational sources for learning chemistry were: One, the acquisition of a good profession in the future (instrumental motivation); and two, cognitive movitavation, or simply the positive feeling one experiences from learning something new. The Achievement Motivational questionnaires revealed that participants' need to avoid failure was lower in comparison to general pupils.",0,0,Social Sciences - Other Topics

Method In 2012, the authors surveyed 1,269 third-year students at eight U.S. medical schools. Items explored student exposure to, attitudes toward, and future plans regarding drug company interactions. The authors compared 2012 survey data with their 2003 survey data from third-year students at the same schools. Results The 2012 response rate was 68.2% (866/1,269). Compared with 2003, in 2012, students were significantly less frequently exposed to interactions (1.6/month versus 4.1/month, P < .001), less likely to feel entitled to gifts (41.8% versus 80.3%, P < .001), and more apt to feel gifts could influence them (44.3% versus 31.2%, P < .001). In 2012, 545/839 students (65.0%) reported private outpatient offices were the main location of exposure to pharmaceutical representatives, despite spending only 18.4% of their clerkship-rotation time there. In 2012, 310/703 students (44.1%) were unaware their schools had rules restricting interactions, and 467/837 (55.8%) planned to interact with pharmaceutical representatives during residency. Conclusions Students in 2012 had less exposure to drug company interactions and were more likely to have skeptical attitudes than students in 2003. These changes are consistent with national organizations' recommendations to limit and teach about these interactions. Continued efforts to study and influence students' and physician role models' exposures to and attitudes about drug companies are warranted.",16,17,Education & Educational Research; Health Care Sciences & Services

It is a cooperative venture by the scientists and governments of the region with founding members Bahrain, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Pakistan, Palestine Authority, and Turkey. Iran is in the process of finalizing its formal membership. Other countries (Cyprus, Morocco, and the United Arab Emirates) are also expected to join. The permanent Council of member states has full responsibility for the project. Members provide the annual operating budget. Observer countries are Germany, Greece, Italy, Kuwait, Portugal, Russian Federation, Sweden, the UK, and the US. SESAME is being developed under the umbrella of UNESCO. Jordan was selected as the building site. SESAME will offer excellent opportunities for training of Middle East scientists and attract those working abroad to consider returning. SESAME will be a 2.5GeV 3rd Generation light source (emittance 26nm-rad, circumference similar to 133m), providing excellent performance for structural molecular biology, molecular environmental science, surface and interface science, microelectromechanical devices, x-ray imaging, archaeological microanalysis, and materials characterization. It will cover a broad spectral range from the infrared to hard x-rays and will have 12 straight sections for insertion devices (average length 2.75m). The injector will be the BESSY I 0.8 GeV booster synchrotron which has been given as a gift from Germany. Four committees advise the Council and assist in developing the technical design, beam lines, user community, and scientific Program. The SESAME building, now in construction with funds and a site provided by Jordan, is scheduled for completion in late 2006 after which the BESSY I injector will be installed. First stored beam in the new 2.5 GeV ring is planned for 2009 with six initial beamlines planned. Some beamlines will be built by member countries. Additional funds to purchase components of the new ring and beamlines are being sought from the EU, the US, and other sources. SESAME has benefited greatly from offers by other light source facilities of equipment and training fellowships in both accelerator technology and applications of synchrotron radiation. Details of this, and other aspects of the training program, are given below.

The sample included 35 PD patients and 26 healthy controls (HC). Cognitive assessment followed an extensive neuropsychological battery. For resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) analysis, independent component analysis (ICA) was performed and components were located in 7 networks: Subcortical (SC), Auditory (AUD), Somatomotor (SM), visual (VI), cognitive-control (CC), default-mode (DMN), and cerebellar (CB). Dynamic FC analysis was performed using the GIFT toolbox. FC differences between groups in each FC state were analysed with the network-based statistic (NBS) approach. Finally, a graph-theoretical analysis for local/global parameters was performed. The whole sample showed 2 dynamic FC states during the rs-fMRI. PD-MCI patients showed decreased mean dwell time in the hypo-connectivity state ( p = 0.030) and showed increased number of state transitions (p = 0.007) compared with the HC. In addition, in the hypo-connectivity state, PD-MCI patients showed reduced inter-network FC between the SM-CC, SM-VI, SM-AUD, CC-VI and SC-DMN compared with the HC ( p < 0.05FDR). These FC alterations in PD-MCI were accompanied by graph-topological alterations in nodes located in the SM network ( p < 0.001). In contrast, no differences were found between the PD-NC and HC.

A high defect density of 13.4-23.7 x 10(10) cm(-2) was obtained in the 3DG due to the incomplete replication. Simultaneously, the broken asymmetry of space charges in the defect sites will lead to the separation of space charges and the formation of electric dipoles, which results in significantly enhanced dielectric performance and microwave absorption. Consequently, owing to the porous structure and high specific surface area, the effective absorption band of the 3DG attains a large width of 14.3 GHz (3.7-18 GHz) with the absorber thicknesses located in 2-5 mm. The microwave absorption performance of 3DG is much superior to that of multilayer graphene with a two-dimensional structure.

The method of project-based learning has recently gained the great popularity. However, the adoption of project-based learning into the educational process and its theoretical comprehension have been affected to some extent by a phenomenon such as fashion, therefore, there has been misunderstanding on the part of this method potential among the research and teaching staff. The possible disappointment in its results, where there are reasons to doubt its effectiveness, can cause a backlash and retard its application. The reassessment of its results, in turn, can cause a backlash and retard its methodological and methodical tools application that has a really high potential. The aims of the study are the following: to define and analyse insufficiently highlighted problematic aspects of the project-based learning in scientific publications; to justify the need for a differentiated approach to its use. Methodology and research methods. The study methodology is based on the system-based and practice-oriented approaches; the methods of experiment, description, comparison, structural and comparative analyses of empirical data were applied. Results and scientific novelty. The author describes the long-term teaching experience based on the project method while training the students of the system of higher and secondary professional education mastering the technologies of a promotional video production. The virtues and shortcomings of this method, favorable conditions for its realization are considered; a number of the methodical recommendations that enable to increase its effectiveness are given; typical mistakes which are made when introducing similar training are noted. The use of the project method brings closer the process of the specialists' training to real professional activity; removes a problem of restriction of school hours; gives opportunities of peer learning of students and acquisition of the program of courses by them at individual speed; significantly stimulates educational motivation of students and promotes growth of their professional competence through the well-advised organization of work on the project, its constant control and objective assessment by independent experts of a final design product.The use of the project-based learning method is not universally effective. It contributes more to the development of the abilities of more gifted students, but can negatively affect the progress of poorly motivated students. Projects can be realized within the framework of one studied discipline, if its content and structure create conditions for this. In other cases, it will require a substantial restructuring of the educational process, careful prediction of its final results, change of approaches to teaching all disciplines, and accordance of the educational curricula to design technologies.

The action is defined with it being given a ring which resides in various scenes and inscriptions featuring different ornamentation as well as in different individuals' hands. The majority of the scenes depict the carrying of the ring in hands between two personalities: Ahura Mazda and the king, the goddess and the king, the queen and satrap, the queen and the king, the king and the successor and the goddess and the goddess. It is worth mentioning that the ring is only in the hand of one figure with no counterpart in some of the science. The archaeologists doing research in this regard, including Roman Ghirshman, Luis Vandenberg, Robert Hertsfeld, John Kurtis, Sayyed Rasoul Musavi, Haji Ali Akbar Sarafraz and others, have all pointed to one single subject indicating that the intended ring is a sign of granting the kingship ring, sultanate or power with the explanation being that the ring gifted from the God to the king indicates His granting of power and sultanate to the king and/or the granting of the ring by the king to the satrap is indicative of his gifting of power to satrap hence legitimizing him. The present study aims at criticizing the theory and determining the semantic and symbolic load of the ring role as well as the ring's different use cases in the various scenes. According to the researches done by the author in the present study, the granting of the ring with the objective of transferring the power or sultanate cannot perfectly convey the content of the inscriptions and many contradictions come about in various scenes considering such a semantic load. That is because the symbolic load of the ring is defined based on a deductive reasoning in doing so. It was concluded in an investigation of the extant inscriptions and recognition of the content of each work that the ring can be an indicator of the unification between two opposing personalities hence reflective of the unity and association in religious and political terms in such a manner that the carrying of the ring in hand between the God and the king showcases the unification between these two personalities and it can be stated that both personalities exemplify their own specific procedures. King stands for government and Ahura Mazda models religion and, considering that both these figures have taken the ring of unification in their hands, it is illustrative of the unification between the government or sultanate with religion or creed and a supernatural power. It is noteworthy that there is a defining of a special subject in every scene wherein unification has been demonstrated. This underlying subject has been classified into three sets by the author: 1) established unification; 2) unification in progress; 3) unification request. The present study introduces scenes of the inscriptions with ring of unification following which the issue will be perfectly analyzed and interpreted.

The results confirm that there is an approximately linear decrease in test scores across months of birth for all grades and both genders. Consequently, students born early in the year are more likely to end up at higher achievement levels than students born later in the year.

V5+ doping, while having similar effects, results in an enhanced polarization, with comparable dielectric loss characteristics. Complex doping of both La3+ and V5+ in PLZTV, while reducing the polarization relative to PZTV, significantly decreases the coercive field. Hybrid films have a greater uniformity of grain formation than non-hybrid films, thus decreasing the coercive field, leakage current and polarization fatigue while increasing the relative permittivity. Analysis using X-ray diffraction (XRD) verified the retention of the PZT perovskite structure in the novel films. PLZT/PZTV has been identified as an optimal ferroelectric film composition due to its desirable ferroelectric, fatigue and dielectric properties, including the highest observed remnant polarization (P-r) of similar to 25 mu C/cm(2), saturation polarization (P-sat) of similar to 58 mu C/cm(2) and low coercive field (E-c) of similar to 60 kV/cm at an applied field of similar to 1000 kV/cm, as well as a low leakage current density of similar to 10(-5) A/cm(2) at 500 kV/cm and fatigue resistance of up to similar to 10(10) switching cycles.

We aimed to investigate several qualitatively different exercise formats on kindergarteners' inhibition. Participants were 75 children (M age = 68.1 months), recruited from 14 classrooms of three kindergarten schools. They were randomly assigned to three groups: control group, free play group (non-cognitively-engaging PA), and an intervention group (cognitively-engaging PA). The intervention group performed 18 sessions of a cognitively engaging PA (tasks requiring movements and inhibitory behavior skills). We assessed hot and cool aspects of inhibition using the Day-Night Stroop test, Head-Shoulders-Knees-Toes, Gift Wrap, and Snack Delay.

The third item (a head scarf) had no embroidery, but part of it was made of handmade fabric. The artefacts were used in the ritual practice of the northern groups of the Ob Ugrians and were probably imported, since the art of embroidery and the skills of handweaving existed in the 18th-19th centuries only among the southern groups of the Khanty and Mansi. The analysis of fibres and identification of embroidery dyes for hand-woven products of the turn of the 18th-19th centuries were carried out.

Broadly, drug promotion refers to all the informational and persuasive activities of the PT, the effect of which is to induce prescription, supply, purchase, and use of medicinal drugs. It includes the activities of medical representatives, drug advertisements to physicians, provision of gifts and samples, drug package inserts, direct-to-consumer advertisements, periodicals, telemarketing, holding of conferences, symposium and scientific meetings, sponsoring of medical education and conduct of promotional trials. The PI has the right to promote its products, but it should do so in a fair, accurate, and ethical manner. The promotional claims need to be reliable, truthful, informative, balanced, up-to-date, and capable of substantiation in good taste. However, now a days, whilst the promotional methods have become very sophisticated and effective, it was found that while promoting their products, the PI does not adhere to these ethical principles. Hence, in most situations, these lead to irrational use of drugs. This unfortunate situation could be tackled only by the multiple prong strategy involving government, PI, doctors, medical associations and consumers. The government is required to formulate some guidelines in addition to developing their own code. The doctors and consumers are required to be educated on the promotional practices and abuses committed by the PI and different ways to tackle those. Various medical and consumer groups should also intervene to improve the scenario of promotion.",14,14,

The Betel Quid Dependence Scale (BQDS) is the first instrument designed specifically to measure betel quid dependence. The three factor structure of the BQDS consists of physical and psychological urgent need, increasing dose, and maladaptive use. The BQDS initially was validated in a sample of male prisoner ex-chewers in Taiwan. Objective: To replicate and extend the original validation research on the BQDS in a sample of male and female current betel quid chewers in Guam. Methods: A survey containing the BQDS was administered to 300 current betel quid chewers in Guam. Participants were compensated for their time with a gift card worth $25. Results: Confirmatory factor analysis revealed an adequate fit with the hypothesized three-factor measurement model. ANOVAs and structural equations modeling revealed that betel quid dependence is associated with the inclusion of tobacco in the quid, number of chews per day, years of chewing, and education. Conclusions: The BQDS is valid for current English-speaking male and female chewers in Guam. Overall levels of betel quid dependence were high, and most chewers included tobacco in their betel quid. The results suggest that levels of dependence for betel quid are similar to those observed for nicotine dependence. Future research should explore other important psychological and behavioral aspects of betel quid chewing such as health risk perceptions and motivation to quit chewing.

The purpose of this study was to investigate how generalized self-disclosure, virginity beliefs, and religiosity, as well as interactions with gender and virginity status, relate to DVS to family, peers, and religious communities. Southern U.S. college students (N = 690) took an online sexuality questionnaire. Generalized self-disclosure did not relate to DVS, suggesting that DVS represents a unique form of self-disclosure. Gender by virginity status interactions suggested that societal double standards of gender and virginity status (i.e., non-virgin women and virgin men being stigmatized for their virginity identifications) may be most relevant to one's decision to disclose to family, and somewhat relevant to one's decision to disclose to religious communities. Individuals high in religiosity overall tended to disclose their virginity status when they identified as a virgin, but not as a non-virgin. Virgins concealed their virginity status from religious communities when they stigmatized their own virginity but disclosed to family and peers when they viewed virginity as a gift. Overall, the results suggest that, although religiosity and virginity beliefs indeed play a role in DVS toward certain targets, one's gender and virginity status appear to be most important.

Both in-focus and out-of-focus particles can be measured by off-axis digital holographic particle imaging but with poor axial resolution.

This paper proposes a compound method of in-line and off-axis digital holographic microscopy to measure the axial displacement of both the in-focus and out-of-focus particle with improved resolution up to nanometer scale collectively. In the proposed compound digital holographic microscopy (CDHM), the critical reconstruction distance (CRD) is calculated. The twin image effect can be resolved by ensuring the reconstruction distance is larger than the CRD, then in-line digital holographic particle imaging can be effectively applied. If the reconstruction distance is smaller than the CRD, the ring pixels of optical path length (RPOPL) method is applied to improve resolution.

The transfiguration of hCG from an impotent waste product in India to a prized pharmaceutical in Europe was made possible by promises of productivity. These promises mobilized a gendered, classed, and racialized relational infrastructure that made the fertility of the urban poor in Kolkata available and valuable for reproductive medicine in the global North. Traces of these relations, however, were obscured by framing transactions as donations, providing return gifts, and declaring urine as raw material. In this article, I make hCG's relational infrastructure legible. Showing how the pharmaceutical has come into being through manifold relations, allows me to analyze processes of valuation that go beyond biological extraction and chemical metamorphosis.",0,0,Anthropology

This substance is a defensive terpenoid that is toxic to the enemies of the beetles. Cantharidin also attracts other groups of insects and has been used as a bait to trap them. Cantharidin-baited traps deployed in central Japan captured coleopterans (Anthicidae, Endomychidae, Pyrochroidae, and Scarabaeidae), dipterans (Ceratopogonidae), hymenopterans (Formicidae), and harvestmen (Podoctidae). The seasonal occurrences of these arthropods, their sex ratios, known feeding choices, and mating habits suggest three possible underlying reasons for the attractancy of cantharidin: (i) it is accumulated as a defense against enemies and sometimes for transfer from males to females as a nuptial gift; (ii) it is used as a chemical cue in food searching; and (iii) it is used as an aggregation pheromone by mature arthropod individuals. The group of canthariphilous arthropods we describe represents a cryptic ecological assemblage with rare chemical networking among apparently unrelated species.",13,17,Entomology

Industrialization, infrastructure development, urbanisation, tourism, mechanized fishing, disposal of industrial and urban wastes and effluents, are all ringing the death-knell of the sensitive coastal ecosystems of recently separated State of Andhra Pradesh. These modern interventions have been violent, disregarding both nature's rejuvenating mechanisms, and the symbiotic relationship that exist between the coast and traditional marine fishing communities. Modern fishing tecnologies using mechanized trawlers and small meshed nets lead directly to overexploitation, which is not sustainable. It is evident that fish have to breed successfully and need to have time to grow if the yield has to be used sustainably. Multiple pressures and excessive technological invasion on these marine fishing villages had created an environment in which life has become physically and mentally unhealthy. The focus of this paper is to emphasize that investing in large-scale industrial fishing, building bigger boats, and giving subsidies for pursuing deep sea fishing would be a waste of resources as the fish hauls in these selelctive districts i.e. Krishna, Guntur, Prakasam and Nellore coastal communities have dropped off alarmingly in recent years. It is essential and crucial to focus research and scientific analysis and establish awareness and education to provide a means of distinguishing responses between improvements in quality of ecosystem and those of damages. The study is to elaborate that long-term ecological gains cannot be sacrificed for short-term economic gains that unfortunately lead to environmental damage. Investigating coastal regulations, policies, and their implementation is an urgent social need for the sake of socio-ecological safety and security of coasts and host communities.

The aim of this study was to investigate the socio-demographic determinants of recent HIV testing among older persons in selected rural districts in Uganda. Methods A cross-sectional survey of 649 older men and women age 50 years and older, from central (Masaka district) and western (Hoima district) Uganda was conducted. Frequency distributions, chi-square tests and multivariable logistic regressions were used to examine the association between recent HIV testing and selected explanatory variables. Results Nearly six in ten (58%) of older persons had primary education. About 60% of the respondents were in union and 13% of them had two or more spouses. Half of the older people (51%) had sex in the last twelve months. A quarter (25%) of older persons gave or received gifts in exchange for sex in their lifetime. Nearly a third (29%) reported sexually transmitted infections in the last 12 months. Prevalence of lifetime HIV testing was 82% and recent (last 12 months) HIV testing was 53%. HIV testing in the last 12 months was associated with age (OR = 0.50; 95% CI: 0.31-0.79), self-reported sexually transmitted infections (OR = 1.59; 95% CI: 1.00-2.30), male circumcision (OR = 1.71; 95% CI: 1.0-2.93), and sexual activity in the last 12 months (OR = 2.89; 95% CI: 1.83-4.57).

Here, we perform electrochemically induced surface reconstruction of an adaptive hydrangea-like heterojunction (NS/NOOH), where crystalline NiOOH is epitaxially grown on the surface of NiSe nanorods (NS) to induce lattice mismatch and then generate interfacial stress. This lattice strain combined with the sufficient exposure of electrochemically active sites gifted by the hydrangea-like structure and the synergistic interfacial effect between the phases endows NS/NOOH-30 with a 25-fold and 30-fold improvement in OER performance compared with the NS/NOOH counterpart without stress during the initial cycle and original NS, respectively. Only 260 mV of overpotential is required even at high current densities (j = 500 mA cm(-2)), which meets the industrial requirements.

Understanding the reactivity of various Fischer-type omega-alkynyloxy chromium carbene complexes with kendomycin analogue syntheses led to achievement of the total synthesis of kendomycin.

The synthetic base population was formed in 2007 from the best performing individuals for growth produced from a complete diallel cross involving three strains of Nile tilapia, namely GIFT (Genetically Improved Farmed Tilapia), Taiwan and NOVIT4 (GIFT-derived) strains. Selection was practised for increased harvest weight in brackish water (15-20 ppt) over four generations from 2008 to 2011. A total of 12,006 individuals had performance data records. They were offspring of 341 sires and 450 dams (averaging 3000 offspring and 70 sires and 90 dams in each generation). Mixed models fitted to the data included the fixed effects of generation, sex, their two way interaction and a linear covariate of age within sex and generation. The random terms in the model were sire within generation and dam within sire and generation. The estimates of heritability for body traits and survival were moderate to high (0.27 to 0.53). Genetic correlations between harvest weight and body length were high and positive (0.97), whereas those between body traits and survival were low and not significantly different from zero. Genetic gain per generation was measured as estimated breeding values and expressed in actual units (original scale of measurement) and genetic standard deviation unit (sigma(G)). The improvement achieved for harvest weight ranged from 1.1 to 1.6 sG after four generations of selection (one year per generation). Selection for increased harvest weight was however accompanied by a non-significant decrease in survival by -0.24%-units or -0.16 sigma(G). The large genetic variation in both harvest weight and survival, however, suggests that there is a scope for simultaneous improvement of both traits in this population of Nile tilapia. It is concluded that our selective breeding programme has succeeded in developing a productive strain of Nile tilapia under brackish water systems, but the future work should include survival rate in the recording system, selection index and breeding objective.

DESIGN: Questionnaire survey. METHODS: A questionnaire on behavior and attitudes toward interactions with pharmaceutical representatives was distributed to 110 ophthalmology residency programs in the United States. Responses were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-two responses were received. Most (87%) respondents reported seeing pharmaceutical representatives visiting their program at least once every 1 to 2 months. Most respondents reported having accepted gifts from them. Although only 26% of trainees have changed prescribing behavior based on information provided by pharmaceutical representatives, 77% did so because of available medicine samples. Trainees tended to consider their peers more susceptible than themselves to the influence of pharmaceutical promotions. When asked to rate their agreement to questionnaire statements, with 5 meaning strongly agree and 1 meaning strongly disagree, the average score for Pharmaceutical representatives influence my prescribing was only 2.72, compared with 3.67 for Pharmaceutical representatives influence other physicians' prescribing (P < .0001). Although half of the trainees (51%) acknowledged that their programs have guidelines or policies regarding interactions with the pharmaceutical industry, only 28% reported having received training in this area. CONCLUSIONS: Ophthalmology trainees have frequent encounters with pharmaceutical representatives. The trainees tend to consider their peers more susceptible than themselves to the influence of pharmaceutical promotions. Pharmaceutical representatives seem able to change prescribing practices among trainees they contact by providing information or leaving drug samples. Many trainees have not received any education in this area from their programs. (Am J Ophthalmol 2009;148:619-622. (C) 2009 by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.)",8,8,Ophthalmology

By adopting a family life course perspective, it shows that while housing tenure has relatively little effect on parents' transfer behaviour, mobility between different tenures can elicit or suppress intergenerational support; moreover, the quality of the house positively affects intergenerational co-residence. Support received to acquire a home along one's life course has an important demonstration effect: those parents who have received their home as a gift or have received economic support for buying it are more prone to provide help to their adult children. The empirical results do not allow to identify macro-contextual conditions that shape the effect of parents' housing careers on intergenerational support, but they show that the demonstration effect plays only a marginal role in Southern Europe.",17,17,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public Administration; Urban Studies

Sexually dimorphic species have been used to explore the supposed effect, however, with mixed results. In dwarf spiders (Erigoninae), many species are sexually dimorphic-males possess marked prosomal modifications. These male traits vary from moderate elevations to bizarre shapes in various prosomal regions. Previous studies established that male dwarf spiders produce substances in these prosomal modifications that are taken up by the females. These substances can act as nuptial gifts, which increase the mating probability of males and the oviposition rate in females. Therefore, these dimorphic traits have evolved in the context of sexual selection. Here, we explore the evolutionary lability of this gustatory trait complex with the aim of assessing the role of this trait complex in species divergence by investigating (1) if erigonine modified prosomata are inherently linked to nuptial-gift-producing glands, (2) if the evolution of the glands evolution preceded that of the modified prosomal shapes, and by assessing (3) the occurrence of convergent/divergent evolution and cryptic differentiation. Results We reconstructed the position and extent of the glandular tissue along with the muscular anatomy in the anterior part of the prosoma of 76 erigonine spiders and three outgroup species using X-ray micro-computed tomography. In all but one case, modified prosomata are associated with gustatory glands. We incorporated the location of glands and muscles into an existing matrix of somatic and genitalic morphological traits of these taxa and reanalyzed their phylogenetic relationship. Our analysis supports that the possession of glandular equipment is the ancestral state and that the manifold modifications of the prosomal shape have evolved convergently multiple times. We found differences in gland position between species with both modified and unmodified prosomata, and reported on seven cases of gland loss. Conclusions Our findings suggest that the occurrence of gustatory glands in sexually monomorphic ancestors has set the stage for the evolution of diverse dimorphic external modifications in dwarf spiders. Differences among congeners suggest that the gland position is highly susceptible to evolutionary changes. The multiple incidences might reflect costs of glandular tissue maintenance and nuptial feeding. Our results indicate divergent evolutionary patterns of gustatory-courtship-related traits, and thus a likely facilitating effect of sexual selection on speciation.",3,4,Zoology

We hypothesized that a nutrition-sensitive poultry intervention improves nutritional status of children 6-18 months using a 6-month cluster randomized controlled community trial. Intervention group (IG) children received a gift of two egg-laying hens in a ceremony where children's ownership of the chickens was declared by community leaders. Parents promised to add more hens and feed the owner-child one-egg-a-day. Trained community workers reinforced egg feeding, environmental sanitation and poultry husbandry. Control group (CG) mothers received usual nutrition education on child feeding. At baseline 29.6% of children were stunted, 19.4% underweight and 8.6% wasted. Egg consumption significantly increased only in IG, at 6 months. The intervention increased weight-for-age and weight-for-height z-scores by 0.38 (95% CI = 0.13-0.63) and 0.43 (95% CI = 0.21-0.64), respectively. Binary logit model indicated IG children were 54% (Odds ratio [OR] = 0.46; 95% CI = 0.26-0.84) and 42% (OR = 0.58; 95% CI = 0.37-0.91) less likely to be underweight and stunted, respectively, compared to CG.

We focus on three factors of incentive framing: call to action, definiteness, and incentive forms in order to identify the most effective ways to design incentives for outdoor interactive advertisements. In this study, the offline-to-online interaction process for outdoor advertisements is divided into three steps: QR code scanning, clicking, and registration. The findings demonstrate that call to action influences all three steps of offline-to-online interaction, and positive framing of the call to action stimulates increased interactions. In regard to definiteness, indefinite forms of incentive in the offline advertisements elicit a higher rate of QR code scanning and clicking compared with definite incentive forms. The interactive effect of definiteness and incentive forms is significant: when the incentive offered in outdoor advertising is indefinite, discounts have a stronger effect than gifts; in contrast, when the incentive is definite, the opposite occurs. On the basis of these findings, three managerial insights are proposed: (1) selection of positive framing for call to action; (2) the use of indefinite incentives in offline advertisement to trigger the audience's curiosity; (3) the application of appropriate forms of incentive according to specific scenarios.",7,7,Business & Economics

The contribution that seed from various sources made to the recovery was assessed using semi-structured interviews and morphological and molecular data. Data suggest that diversity had recovered to some extent yet there was evidence of a narrowing of the genetic base, with fewer rare alleles and differences in the distribution of allele frequencies. Although the main channels for accessing seed after the flood were seed relief and markets, these sources contributed to minimal and different diversity. It appears that diversity was regained primarily through social networking in the form of loans or gifts of seed from friends and relatives.

Drawing on three case studies of nonprofit social services in Canada, this article argues that due to austerity policies, the conditions for 'pure' gift relationships in unpaid social service work are increasingly rare. Instead, employers have found various ways to 'fill the gaps' in funding through the extraction of unpaid work in various forms. Precarious workers are highly vulnerable to expectations that they will 'volunteer' at their places of employment, while expectations that students will undertake unpaid internships is increasing the norm for degree completion and procurement of employment, and full-time workers often use unpaid work as a form of resistance. This article contributes to theory by advancing a spectrum of unpaid nonprofit social service work as compelled and coerced to varying degrees in the context of austerity policies and funding cutbacks.",24,24,Social Issues; Social Sciences - Other Topics

Disclosure of industry compensation by authors of scientific manuscripts usually occurs at the authors' discretion and is seldom audited as part of the peer review process. The purpose of this analysis was to characterize industry compensation among highly cited research articles related to aortic aneurysm. Methods: A Web of Science search for English language articles published from 2013-2017 using the search term aortic aneurysm identified publications for this study. The top 99 most-cited publications were abstracted by author. Physician authors with reported industry compensation from 2013-2016 were identified using the ProPublica Dollars for Docs search tool (linked to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Open Payments data), based on provider name, medical specialty, and geographic location. Statistical analysis included descriptive statistics and categorical tests. Results: The 99 articles had 1,264 unique authors, of whom 105 physicians (8.3%) received industry compensation during the study period. Fourteen of the 105 authors self-reported having received industry compensation. The remaining 91 authors (86.7%) did not disclose their industry-reported compensation. Industry payments during the study period totaled $6,082,574 paid through 13,489 transactions from 169 different manufacturers. In-kind items and services were the most common form of payment (65.3%). The median transaction amount was $58.32. [$138.34]. Food and beverage accounted for the largest number of transactions (N=9653), followed by travel and lodging (N=2365), consulting (N=513), and promotional speaking (N=436). Consulting accounted for the most total dollars over the study period ($1,970,606), followed by travel and lodging ($1,122,276), promotional speaking ($972,894), food and beverage ($568,251), royalty or license ($504,631), honoraria ($452,167), and education ($428,489). Royalty and license payments had the highest median transaction amount ($15,418. [$29,049]), and was the only category with a median transaction amount greater than $5,000. In contrast, several categories had median transaction amounts under $50, including food and beverage ($32. [$77]), gifts ($34. [$86]), and entertainment ($30. [$69]). No significant difference in payment amounts by medical specialty was identified (P=0.071). Conclusions: Only 8.3% of physician authors of highly cited aortic aneurysm studies received industry compensation, but 86.7% of those physician authors receiving payments did not disclose industry compensation within the manuscripts. Potential bias associated with industry compensation may be underestimated and conservatively biased based on author self-reporting.",0,0,Surgery; Cardiovascular System & Cardiology

The main objective of our research is a preliminary detection of variations in test scores from a group of children that were identified as having HIA. This was done by means of a single-time assessment of children currently following an enrichment program. A total of n=26 students participated (19 male and 7 female) in the study. The age range was between 12 and 17 years, being the average age 13.89 years (SD = 1.09 years). Differential Aptitude Test (DAT-5) and Torrance Test of Creative Thinking (TTCT) were used to assess the logical-deductive intellectual skills and creative thinking. The results show that test scores may change in a considerable amount in many supposedly HIA individuals. More than 30% of the variance cannot be attributed to common components in the two measurements points. The scores in creativity were the most fluctuating, something that could be expected of these scales having the lowest reliability indexes. Only eight participants remain steady, according to the one standard deviation criterion, and it is quite notorious that two participants show a decrease in three subscales out of five. On the other hand, two other participants have shown an increase in one subscale as well as a decrease in another. In order to foster HIA individuals and their wellbeing, it is essential to be careful with mistaken diagnoses (falsenegatives and false-positives), given the fact that they will lead to developmental consequences.",1,1,Psychology

However, relatively low opening circuit voltage (V-oc) and limited moisture stability have lagged their progress far from the regular. Here, we propose an effective surface treatment strategy with high-temperature FABr treatment to address these issues. The induced ions exchange can not only adjust energy level, but also gift effective passivation. Meanwhile, the gradient distribution of FA(+)can accelerate the carriers transport to further suppress bulk recombination. Besides, the Br-rich surface and FA(+)substitution can isolate moisture erosions. As a result, the optimized devices show champion efficiency of 15.92% withV(oc)of 1.223 V.

After winning their independence, the Indonesian authorities began paying serious attention to the fight against corruption. In 1958, for the first time, on the initiative of the President Sukarno, a special body named the Committee for the Correction of the State Apparatus was created to combat corruption. But, the work of the Committee was sabotaged by officials. As a result, the confrontation between the Committee and the senior government officials led to the bureaucrats' victory. In 1959, the Committee announced its dissolution. In 1963, President Sukarno created a new organization to fight corruption named Operation Budhi. The main task imposed on the new organization by the President was the inspection of the large state-owned enterprises in order to identify corruption schemes and to bring criminal cases before the court for sentencing. A smear media campaign was launched against the investigators working under Operation Budhi; its activity was recognized as ineffective and brought to a stop. Despite all attempts, there were no tangible victories over corruption during the rule of President Sukarno. After the transfer of power from President Sukarno to General Suharto, the corruption in Indonesia reached unprecedented proportions.

Over the decades, a vast count of researchers had undergone in the field of psychological, biological and cognitive sciences to explore how the human brain characterizes, perceives and memorizes faces. Moreover, certain computational advancements have been developed to accomplish several insights into this issue. Design/methodology/approach This paper intends to propose a new race detection model using face shape features. The proposed model includes two key phases, namely. (a) feature extraction (b) detection. The feature extraction is the initial stage, where the face color and shape based features get mined. Specifically, maximally stable extremal regions (MSER) and speeded-up robust transform (SURF) are extracted under shape features and dense color feature are extracted as color feature. Since, the extracted features are huge in dimensions; they are alleviated under principle component analysis (PCA) approach, which is the strongest model for solving curse of dimensionality. Then, the dimensional reduced features are subjected to deep belief neural network (DBN), where the race gets detected. Further, to make the proposed framework more effective with respect to prediction, the weight of DBN is fine tuned with a new hybrid algorithm referred as lion mutated and updated dragon algorithm (LMUDA), which is the conceptual hybridization of lion algorithm (LA) and dragonfly algorithm (DA). Findings The performance of proposed work is compared over other state-of-the-art models in terms of accuracy and error performance. Moreover, LMUDA attains high accuracy at 100th iteration with 90% of training, which is 11.1, 8.8, 5.5 and 3.3% better than the performance when learning percentage (LP) = 50%, 60%, 70%, and 80%, respectively.

The results have ranged from the modest to the extraordinary. Teachers turned to content production at previously unseen levels. While recent years has seen increasing interest in the engagement of teachers with social media as a pedagogical tool and how it can advance their personal and professional capability, little attention has been paid to why and how they invest in creating and distributing pedagogical content via YouTube. This paper explores that question. First, we put forward a theoretical framework to allow better understanding of the issue. This draws from several lines of literature to set out a comprehensive framework to interrogate and contextualize the reasons teachers invest in creating and distributing YouTube content. The second part of our paper presents findings from an ongoing study of 115 teacher-produced YouTube video channels. Initial analysis suggests that the participants place strong value on gifting their knowledge and believe that sharing, contributing and creating new understandings are hallmarks of a more professional digital pedagogy. But the reasons they do so are not heterogeneous. Rather they are complex and in some ways surprising.",2,2,Education & Educational Research

Although Celtis choseniana has been traditionally used as a herbal medicine at Korea, no systemic research has been conducted on its anti-inflammatory activity. Therefore, the present study explored an anti-inflammatory effect and its underlying molecular mechanism using Celtis choseniana methanol extract (Cc-ME) in macrophage-mediated inflammatory responses. In vitro anti-inflammatory activity of Cc-ME was evaluated using RAW264.7 cells and peritoneal macrophages stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), pam3CSK4 (Pam3), or poly(I:C). In vivo anti-inflammatory activity of Cc-ME was investigated using acute inflammatory disease mouse models, such as LPS-induced peritonitis and HCl/EtOH-induced gastritis. The molecular mechanism of Cc-ME-mediated anti-inflammatory activity was examined by Western blot analysis and immunoprecipitation using whole cell and nuclear fraction prepared from the LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells and HEK293 cells. Cc-ME inhibited NO production and mRNA expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase (COX-2), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in the RAW264.7 cells and peritoneal macrophages induced by LPS, pam3, or poly(I:C) without cytotoxicity. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis showed that Cc-ME contained anti-inflammatory flavonoids quercetin, luteolin, and kaempferol. Among those, the content of luteolin, which showed an inhibitory effect on NO production, was highest. Cc-ME suppressed the NF-kappa B signaling pathway by targeting Src and interrupting molecular interactions between Src and p85, its downstream kinase. Moreover, Cc-ME ameliorated the morphological finding of peritonitis and gastritis in the mouse disease models. Therefore, these results suggest that Cc-ME exerted in vitro and in vivo anti-inflammatory activity in LPS-stimulated macrophages and mouse models of acute inflammatory diseases. This anti-inflammatory activity of Cc-ME was dominantly mediated by targeting Src in NF-kappa B signaling pathway during macrophage-mediated inflammatory responses.",16,16,Integrative & Complementary Medicine

However, these practices can fail to yield desired results if customers feel uncomfortable about receiving things that need to be reciprocated. People differ in the degree to which they feel anxious in a situation that requires them to reciprocate or when they anticipate such a situation. This research introduces the construct of reciprocity anxiety to capture this individual difference and distinguish it from other variables. We develop an 11-item scale to measure two components of reciprocity anxiety and find that reciprocity anxiety can predict (1) consumers' avoidance behavior toward businesses that may obligate them to reciprocate; (2) consumers' eagerness to repay a benefit provided by businesses; as well as (3) consumers' intentions to make future visits to businesses that employ reciprocity relationship-building tactics.",12,12,Business & Economics; Psychology

Indeed, our time-sensitive mechanisms are literally carved into our biology and neurology on a molecular level, gifting us with neural clocks. However, time in human consciousness is not the time indicated by physical clocks: time is a subjective reality in our psychological makeup due to the nature of the temporal neural mechanisms and unique properties of physical time. Nonetheless, subjective time requires anchoring to physical time which permeates our language, endeavors, and entire existence, a process hinging on time-related skills such as estimates and measures of passage and duration of time. Moreover, accurate time reading, a critical adaptive life-skill, is imperative for effective function in all societal activities. Because it embodies the complexity of the time construct, it is central to instruction of time concept in primary education. It is often measured in children by clock drawings, a cognitive integrative skill with errors pointing to neuroanatomical differences impacting the integrity of executive function. Time competence in children with atypical neurobiological development and high prevalence, as in autism spectrum disorders (ASD), and attention disorders (ADHD), is often compromised, calling for investigation of its function. This thematic review article aims to: 1) discuss the complexity of time concept and its underlying bio-neurological mechanisms, 2) elucidate difficulties children with ASD and those with ADHD exhibit in temporal development, and 3) demonstrate the use of a set of clinical tools in uncovering temporal competence and ecological executive function in two children with ASD, and a child with ADHD, using a clock drawing task and error analyses; children's time knowledge questionnaire; a behavior rating parent questionnaire examining ecological executive function, and parent open-ended questions related to their children's time difficulties.

Dowry stems from the early concept of 'Stridhana,' in which gifts were given to the bride by her family to secure some personal wealth for her when she married. However, with the transition of time, the practice of dowry is becoming more common, and the demand for a higher dowry becomes a burden to the bride's family. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the factors associated with the practice of dowry in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. Methods We utilized information from 5206 married adolescent girls from the Understanding the lives of adolescents and young adults (UDAYA) project survey conducted in two Indian states, namely, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Dowry was the outcome variable of this study. Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to explore the factors associated with dowry payment during the marriage. Results The study reveals that dowry is still prevalent in the state of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Also, the proportion of dowry varies by adolescent's age at marriage, spousal education, and household socioeconomic status. The likelihood of paid dowry was 48 percent significantly less likely (OR: 0.52; CI: 0.44-0.61) among adolescents who knew their husbands before marriage compared to those who do not know their husbands before marriage. Adolescents with age at marriage more than equal to legal age had higher odds to pay dowry (OR: 1.60; CI: 1.14-2.14) than their counterparts. Adolescents with mother's who had ten and above years of education, the likelihood of dowry was 33 percent less likely (OR: 0.67; CI: 0.45-0.98) than their counterparts. Adolescents belonging to the richest households (OR: 1.48; CI: 1.13-1.93) were more likely to make dowry payments than adolescents belonging to poor households. Conclusion Limitation of the dowry prohibition act is one of the causes of continued practices of dowry, but major causes are deeply rooted in the social and cultural customs, which cannot be changed only using laws. Our study suggests that only the socio-economic development of women will not protect her from the dowry system, however higher dowry payment is more likely among women from better socio-economic class.",1,1,Science & Technology - Other Topics

In younger children the evidence is less clear. Moreover, the specificity of the relation between the autonomic nervous system and different forms of externalising behaviour is uncertain. We investigated the longitudinal relation between resting mean heart rate and different externalising behaviours. MethodsIn 412 children of the Generation R Study, we measured resting mean heart rate at 14months. At 3years, child problem behaviour was assessed by the mother with the Child Behavior Checklist. In a gift delay task, we observed whether children were compliant and whether they lied about their noncompliance. The association of heart rate with behaviour was contrasted with the effect of harsh parenting. ResultsIn our main analysis, we examined the association between heart rate and reported and observed child behaviour. For comparison, the association of heart rate with behaviour was contrasted with the effect of harsh parenting. Mean heart rate was positively associated with Anxious/Depressed scale scores (=.1, 95% CI=0.01; 0.2, p=.04), but not with Aggressive Behaviour (=.02; 95% CI=-0.1; 0.1, p=.8) nor Attention Problem scale scores (=.08, 95% CI=-0.3; 0.5, p=.8). We could not demonstrate an association between mean heart rate and noncompliance during the gift delay task (OR=1.14, 95% CI=0.9; 1.1, p=.2), but lower heart rate predicted higher odds of the child lying (OR=0.56, 95% CI=0.3; 0.9, p=.03). In contrast, harsh parenting was associated with mother-reported Aggressive Behaviour (=.7, 95% CI=0.4; 0.9, p<.001) and Attention Problems (=.2, 95% CI=0.1; 0.3, p<.001), but not with observed lying (OR=1.03, 95% CI=0.8; 1.4, p=.8). ConclusionsLower resting mean heart rate at age 14months predicts low anxiety symptoms and higher odds of lying at age 3years.

Individual differences in general cognitive ability are thought to be mediated by generalist genes that affect many cognitive abilities similarly without specific genetic influences on particular cognitive abilities [1]. In contrast, we present here evidence for cognitive specialist genes: monozygotic twins are more similar than dizygotic twins in the specific cognitive ability of face perception. Each of three measures of face-specific processing was heritable, i.e., more correlated in monozygotic than dizygotic twins: face-specific recognition ability, the face-inversion effect [2], and the composite-face effect [3]. Crucially, this effect is due to the heritability of face processing in particular, not to a more general aspect of cognition such as IQ or global attention. Thus, individual differences in at least one specific mental talent are independently heritable. This finding raises the question of what other specific cognitive abilities are independently heritable and may elucidate the mechanisms by which heritable disorders like dyslexia and autism can have highly uneven cognitive profiles in which some mental processes can be selectively impaired while others remain unaffected or even selectively enhanced.",161,164,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Cell Biology

The Medi-Cal Incentives to Quit Smoking program provided incentives to adults on Medi-Cal to call the California Smokers Helpline (Helpline) from March 2012 to July 2015. This analysis examined reach of the Medi-Cal Incentives to Quit Smoking program among pregnant and parenting women. Methods: This study examined caller data from the Helpline from 2010 to 2015 among women of reproductive age (18-45 years) enrolled in Medi-Cal (n=32,691; analyzed in 2017/2018). The authors calculated the annual percentage of the target population reached who called the Helpline by pregnancy status and used adjusted prevalence ratios to examine the associations between Medi-Cal Incentives to Quit Smoking incentive period, pregnancy/parenting status, Medi-Cal Incentives to Quit Smoking incentives ($20 gift card and nicotine patch), and counseling. Results: Over the study period, the percentage of the target population reached increased for women of reproductive age (2.1% in 2011 to 3.0% in 2014) and pregnant women (2.1% in 2011 to 3.3% in 2014). The percentage of women who asked for the $20 gift card (13.6%) was not substantially different by pregnancy status, and WIC and nonprofits were important referral sources. Pregnant women were less likely to receive nicotine patches, but there was a 3- to 4-fold increase during the Medi-Cal Incentives to Quit Smoking incentive period for both pregnant and nonpregnant women. Among nonpregnant women, counseling decreased 14% during the Medi-Cal Incentives to Quit Smoking incentive period. Conclusions: Results suggest that the nicotine patch incentives motivated women to call the Helpline, even pregnant women who needed a physician's approval consistent with current American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists cautions about the appropriateness of the patch during pregnancy.

The factorial invariance and structural latent mean differences were investigated. Confirmatory factor analyses of both samples supported a structure comprising two higher-order factors of entity and incremental beliefs underpinned by beliefs that athletic ability is stable and a gift (entity) and is open to improvement and can be developed through learning (incremental). The pooled data analysis provided evidence for the cross-cultural applicability of the measurement model. Multigroup analysis demonstrated invariance of the factor forms, factor loadings, factor variances, and factor covariances. However, the latent mean structures of all dimensions measured by the CNAAQ-2 were not equivalent for the UK and Singaporean samples, suggesting that there may be cultural influences in terms of mean scores of the constructs in children and youth across the two countries.

Physical activity confers a 25% reduction in mortality; however, physical activity is widely underused. Thus, there is a need for more powerful behavioral interventions to promote physical activity. Our objective was to motivate patients to achieve an increase in expenditure of 336 kcal/wk or more at 12 months as assessed by the Paffenbarger Physical Activity and Exercise Index. Methods: Two hundred forty-two patients were recruited immediately after percutaneous coronary intervention between October 2004 and October 2006. Patients were randomized to 1 of 2 groups. The patient education (PE) control group (n=118) (1) received an educational workbook, (2) received a pedometer, and (3) set a behavioral contract for a physical activity goal. The positive-affect/self-affirmation (PA) intervention group (n=124) received the 3 PE control components plus (1) a PA workbook chapter, (2) bimonthly induction of PA by telephone, and (3) small mailed gifts. All patients were contacted with standardized bimonthly telephone follow-up for 12 months. Results: Attrition was 4.5%, and 2.1% of patients died. Significantly more patients in the PA intervention group increased expenditure by 336 kcal/wk or more at 12 months, our main outcome, compared with the PE control group (54.9% vs 37.4%, P=.007). The PA intervention patients were 1.7 times more likely to reach the goal of a 336-kcal/wk or more increase by 12 months, controlling for demographic and psychosocial measures.

To address these issues, the Sustainable Action against HIV and AIDS in Communities (SAHACOM) project has been implemented since late 2009 using a community-based approach to integrate HIV and SRH services. This study evaluates the impact of the SAHACOM on sexual and healthcare-seeking behaviors among FEWs in Cambodia. Methods: A midterm and endpoint comparison design was utilized. Midterm data were collected in early 2012, and endpoint data were collected in early 2014. A two-stage cluster sampling method was used to randomly select 450 women at midterm and 556 women at endpoint for face-to-face interviews. Results: Compared to women at midterm, women at endpoint were significantly less likely to report having sexual intercourse in exchange for money or gifts in the past three months (OR = 2.1, 95 % CI = 1.6-2.7). The average number of commercial sexual partners in the past three months also decreased significantly from 5.5 (SD = 13.3) at midterm to 3.6 (SD = 13.9) at endpoint (p = 0.03). However, women at endpoint were significantly less likely to report always using condom when having sexual intercourse with clients in exchange for money or gifts (OR = 2.6, 95 % CI = 1.5-4.5). Regarding sexually transmitted infections (STIs), women at endpoint were significantly less likely to report having an STI symptom in the past three months (OR = 1.8, 95 % CI = 1.4-2.3) and more likely to seek treatment for the most recent STI symptom (OR = 1.6, 95 % CI = 1.1-1.9). Furthermore, women at endpoint were significantly more likely to be currently using a contraceptive method (OR = 1.4, 95 % CI = 1.1-1.8) and less likely to report having an induced abortion (OR = 1.4, 95 % CI = 1.1-1.7) during the time working as a FEW.

The valve complex is composed of two plate-like sclerites, a closure element, and in-and-outflow canals. Females have a penis-like intromittent organ to coercively anchor males and obtain voluminous semen. The semen is packed in a capsule, whose formation is initiated by seminal injection. It is not only used for fertilization but also consumed by the female as nutrition. The valve complex has two slots for insemination so that Neotrogla can continue mating while the first slot is occupied. In conjunction with the female penis, this switching valve is a morphological novelty enabling females to compete for seminal gifts in their nutrient-poor cave habitats through long copulation times and multiple seminal injections. The evolution of this switching valve may have been a prerequisite for the reversal of the intromittent organ in Neotrogla.",8,8,Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics

Participants were instructed to decide the valence of target words, and their electroencephalogram was recorded at the same time. The behavioral and event-related potential (ERP) results showed that positive words produced a priming effect whereas negative words inhibited target word processing (Experiment 1). In Experiment 2, the inhibition effect of negative emotion-label words on emotion word recognition was found in both behavioral and ERP results, suggesting that modulation of emotion word type on emotion word processing could be observed even in the masked priming paradigm. The two experiments further supported the necessity of defining emotion words under an emotion word type perspective. The implications of the findings are proffered. Specifically, a clear understanding of emotion-label words and emotion-laden words can improve the effectiveness of emotional communications in clinical settings.

To confirm construct validity and examine the associations of gender and school type with both fixed intelligent and creative mindsets, we fit a two-factor model within the structural equation model. We found significant associations of school type and gender with students' fixed intelligence mindset and fixed creative mindset. Three paths-gender -> fixed intelligence mindset, school type -> fixed intelligence mindset, and school type -> fixed creative mindset-were significant. In Western countries where mindset research originated and developed, there have already been efforts to manage students' mindsets with policies. However, Asian countries still lack understanding of and basic research on mindset management.

This can be explained by the persistently low rate of consistent condom use among this population. This study was therefore conducted to explore factors associated with consistent condom use among sexually-active transgender women in Cambodia, specifically with their non-commercial partners. Methods: Data used for this study were collected as part of the National Integrated Biological and Behavioral Survey 2016. Participants were recruited from the capital city of Phnom Penh and 12 other provinces with high burden of HIV using the Respondent-Driven Sampling (RDS) method. Face-to-face interviews were conducted using a structured questionnaire. Weighted multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to explore independent factors associated with consistent condom use. Results: This study included 1202 transgender women who reported having anal sex with at least one male partner not in exchange for money or gifts in the past three months. The mean age of the participants was 26.0 (SD = 7.0) years. Of the total, 41.5% reported always using condoms with male non-commercial partners in the past three months. After adjustment, the likelihood of consistent condom use was significantly higher among participants who resided in an urban community (AOR = 1.7, 95% CI = 1.1-2.6), had attained at least 10 years of formal education (AOR = 1.8, 95% CI = 1.2-2.7), perceived that they were likely or very likely to be HIV infected (AOR = 2.9, 95% CI = 2.0-4.1), reported drinking alcohol two to three times per week (AOR = 3.1, 95% CI = 1.1-8.3), reported using amphetamine-type stimulants (AOR = 1.9, 95% = 1.1-3.8) or other drugs (AOR = 7.6, 95% CI = 1.5-39.5), and reported inconsistent condom use with male commercial partners in the past three months (AOR = 4.3, 95% CI = 1.8-10.4) compared to that of their respective reference group. Conclusions: This study confirms the low rates of condom use, particularly in non-commercial relationship, among transgender women in Cambodia. To address these concerns, efforts towards education about effects of multiple, concurrent relationships, and inconsistent condom use should be reinforced among transgender women.",6,6,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"

Reusing water-contained flocs was initially inoculated into six 300L indoor tanks. Thirty fish (average individual weight 99.62 +/- 7.34g) were stocked in each tank. Glucose was extra added into three tanks (GLU-tanks) according to biofloc technology, while other tanks were no carbohydrate added (NCA-tanks). Concentrations of total ammonia nitrogen in GLU-tanks and NCA-tanks were fairly consistent and below 4.74 +/- 0.35mg/L. Nitrite concentrations in NCA-tanks were significantly lower than GLU-tanks, which were below 0.59 +/- 0.10mg/L during the later culture period. NCA-tanks achieved a low relative abundance of denitrifiers and high concentrations of nitrate. Soluble reactive phosphorous in NCA-tanks was consistently increased, which was decreased to a low level in GLU-tanks.

Apart from being sustainable, biodegradable, and renewable, wood is also extremely fascinating from the application aspect, with numerous advantages including hierarchical and macroporous structure, excellent mechanical performance, and versatile chemistry. The macroporous structure of wood is comprised of numerous long, partially aligned channels along the growth direction. This structure is suitable for a range of emerging applications, especially as a separation/membrane material. In this research, the potentiality of Gingko biloba (Gb) wood in the remediation of wastewater, contaminated with methylene blue (MB), a dye found in the industrial waters, was investigated. We report a macroporous, three-dimensional (3D) Gb-wood membrane decorated with palladium nanoparticles (Pd NPs) for efficient wastewater treatment. The efficiency of the Pd NPs/Gb-wood membrane to remove MB from a flowing aqueous solution was demonstrated. The wastewater treatment rate of the 3D Pd NPs/Gb-wood membrane can reach 0.5 L/min, with a high MB removal efficiency (>99.9%). The 3D Gb-wood macroporous membrane with partially aligned channels exhibits promising results for water treatment and is applicable for an even wider range of separation applications. In addition, the benefit of this 3D-wood membrane system for wastewater treatment was evaluated against the potential impacts on the environment and human health by employing the life-cycle assessment (LCA) approach. The LCA was carried out using the Gabi-education version with the gate-to-grave approach, including industrial wastewater, 3D-wood membrane, and electricity consumption using CML (Centrum VoorMilieukunde Leiden). From the LCA, it can be observed that wastewater filtration using this membrane exhibited a better environmental footprint due to the improved performance of the membrane in treating a higher volume of the permeate. Therefore, this filtration system had outweighed the additional environmental impact of the wastewater treatment process. The energy demand was identified as the main environmental hotspot in the LCA analysis. The analysis revealed that the energy source for electricity generation had a significant influence on the overall sustainability of this system. Additionally, the wood itself, a naturally abundant and eco-friendly material, presented zero environmental hazard to the environment during the filtration process. The experimental and environmental impact results indicate that Gb-wood can be employed as a natural and eco-friendly adsorbent material for the removal of waste from aqueous solutions.",6,7,Chemistry

We carried out laboratory experiments of a pay-it-forward indirect reciprocity game (i.e., chained gift-giving game) on a large scale in terms of group size and time. We found that cooperation consistent with pay-it-forward reciprocity occurred only in a first few decisions per participant and that cooperation originated from inherent pro-sociality of individuals. In contrast, the same groups of participants showed persisting chains of cooperation in a different indirect reciprocity game in which participants earned reputation by cooperating.

The current version of the Amadis database documents 20167 associations between 221 human diseases and 774 gut microbes across 17 species, curated from more than 1000 articles. By using the curated data, users can freely select and combine modules to obtain a specific microbe-based human disease network. Additionally, Amadis provides a user-friendly interface for browsing, searching and downloading. We hope it can serve as a useful and valuable resource for researchers exploring the associations between gastrointestinal microbiota and human diseases.",9,8,Physiology

One of the purposes of the present work is to show the lack of differences between boys and girls in creativity; the other is the possibility of improving creativity among high-ability students who received specific training as part of their intra-curricular content in a total grouping program for gifted students. Method: The sample consisted of 42 students from first to third grade (13 females and 29 males) and 58 students from fourth to sixth grade (21 females and 37 males). Creativity was measured with the CREA test for younger students and with the PIC-N for older students. Training was carried out through an Integral Innovation and Creativity Program (PIIC). Results: The results showed no differences between genders, except in one of the graphic creativity scales (Details). There were improvements due to the training in all measures of narrative creativity and in the scale of elaboration of graphic creativity. Conclusions: The main conclusions are the importance of increasing creativity with specific programs and the need to improve interventions in graphic creativity.",0,0,Pediatrics

The relevance of the topic is determined by the state program for the identification and support of gifted children. A longitudinal study of children aged 8-12 years (n = 42) using the Creative Field method allows us to trace the formation and development of their giftedness. This method allows for a differentiated diagnosis of the ability to develop activities on their own initiative (heuristic level of activity) or its absence (stimulus-productive level of activity). Intelligence was assessed by J. Raven's test and the indicators of learning ability of the Creative Field method. In connection with the widespread understanding of giftedness, which reduces it to a high level of intelligence, a hypothesis was put forward about the range of IQ indices, which may be wider in the stimulus-productive group than in the group of heurists, but its upper bounds for these groups should be close. High values of intelligence in both groups are the basis for the conclusion that it is impossible to reduce giftedness only to a high level of intelligence. Giftedness is manifested in the integration of intelligence, the lower limit of which is determined by the ability to master the proposed activity, with the dominant cognitive motivation in the personality structure.",0,0,Psychology

In both settings, need satisfaction predicted high-ability students' motivational outcomes. These findings could be explained by the qualitative findings from Study 2 which indicated that high-ability students (N = 11) experienced pull-out class teachers as more supportive of their needs than their regular class teachers.

Wealth inequality is decreasing overtime, and many households work their way out of poverty and lower wealth over the seven year period. The accounts establish that, mechanically, this is largely due to savings rather than incoming gifts and remittances. In turn, the growth of net worth can be decomposed household by household into the savings rate and how productively that savings is used, the return on assets (ROA). The latter plays the larger role. ROA is, in turn, positively correlated with higher education of household members, younger age of the head, and with a higher debt/asset ratio and lower initial wealth, so it seems from cross-sections that the financial system is imperfectly channeling resources to productive and poor households. Household fixed effects account for the larger part of ROA, and this success is largely persistent, undercutting the story that successful entrepreneurs are those that simply get lucky. Persistence does vary across households, and in at least one province with much change and increasing opportunities, ROA changes as households move over time to higher-return occupations. But for those households with high and persistent ROA, the savings rate is higher, consistent with some micro founded macro models with imperfect credit markets. Indeed, high ROA households save by investing in their own enterprises and adopt consistent financial strategies for smoothing fluctuations. More generally growth of wealth, savings levels and/or rates are correlated with TFP and the household fixed effects that are the larger part of ROA. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In this work, using the gifted MIL-88A@GO as a precursor, we fabricate a FeS2/Fe2O3 heterostructure-coupled S-functionalized 3D rGO network (FeS2/Fe2O3@S-rGO) by a diffusion-controlled etching and vulcanizing process. The formation of heterogeneous interfaces and the strongly coupled interaction between the FeS2/Fe2O3 heterostructure and 3D S-rGO can provide high surface area for more electrochemical active sites, a rich pathway for the rapid transmission of the electron and electrolyte, and effectively alleviate the volume variation in the charging and discharging process. Therefore, the as-obtained FeS2/Fe2O3@S-rGO presents an outstanding capacity of 219.4 mA h g(-1) (790 F g(-1)) at a current density of 2 A g(-1), which is higher than that of most reported Fe-based negative materials. Then, a positive electrode of hierarchical 2D/3D Ni3S2/Co3S4 (NCS) is prepared and further fabricated with a FeS2/Fe2O3@S-rGO electrode to obtain a hybrid supercapacitor device (NCS//FeS2/Fe2O3@S-rGO), which delivers an outstanding overall capacitance value of 114.2 mA h g(-1) (274 F g(-1)) at 1 A g(-1) and provides a remarkable energy density of 85.63 Wh kg(-1) corresponding to a power density of 0.75 kW kg(-1).",18,17,Chemistry; Energy & Fuels; Materials Science

He is depicted as a powerful shaman who transforms the world through magic. In this paper, I analyze an often-neglected motif of Alaskan Athabascan Raven stories: Raven as Dog-eaters. I use mythological texts and ethnographic data collected in prior studies and from my fieldwork in the community of Nikolai, Alaska. In some Alaskan Athabascan myths, Raven has a strong appetite for dog meat and assists his neighbors who slaughter their dogs for him. This motif seems to describe a sacrificial practice whereby Raven, as a transformer, receives gifts of food in exchange for providing spiritual services and protection. However, in real life, Northern Athabascans do not practice typical animal sacrifice involving domestic animals. In addition, they do not regard dogs as being suitable for human consumption. This raises several questions. What is the significance of dogs in Alaskan Athabascan societies? Why is Raven thought to be fond of dog meat in traditional Alaskan Athabascan stories? How can we explain this motif of Dog as Raven's Delicacy through an ethnography of human-dog-raven relations in Alaskan Athabascan societies? This paper addresses these questions from the perspectives of comparative mythology, ethology and the storytelling strategy.",0,0,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology

Anonymous blood samples were taken for HIV testing. Positive HIV antibodies were determined and confirmed by two Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assays (ELISA). Of 1104 youth interviewed, 91% (1003) consented for blood specimen taking. Seven out of ten youth volunteered to have had sexual intercourse at least once in their lifetime; 60% reported to consume alcohol and 50% of the sexually experienced females reported to have received a gift for their sexual encounter. The overall HIV seroprevalence was 7.5% (75/1003); females compared to males were twice as likely to be HIV positive, 9.7% and 5% respectively. Behavioural risk factors associated with HIV seropositivity were different in male compared to female youth. Among male subjects, cigarette smoking, ever use of marijuana and having a past history of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) were significant risk factors associated with increased risk of HIV seropositivity, On the other hand, in females, those with a past or current history of STDs, those who volunteered that they practiced oral sex and subjects with four or more lifetime sexual partners were more likely to be HIV positive than subjects without a history of an STD, those with single sexual partner or had never practiced oral sex. A four fold increased risk of HIV seropositivity was also observed among female subjects with a history of blood transfusion in the previous 10 years compared to having received none, the Odds ratio was 4.1 (95% CI=1.5, 11.1). The profile of risk behaviour associated with HIV seropositivity calls for an urgent need to target health information and education interventions to bring about a change in behaviour among the youth and hopefully help to reduce the rate of transmission of HIV infection.",20,20,General & Internal Medicine

The micelle presented increased monodispersity in more concentrated aqueous solution. The OSA-starch molecules with the highest M-w formed the largest micelle. Hydrodynamic radius (R-h) via dynamic light scattering of the micelle with the highest M-w decreased in larger extent (from 80 nm to 46 nm), as well as more distinct change of R-g/R-h with increasing concentration, from which it could be deduced that the micelle conformation with higher M-w was more flexible and more sensitive to the interparticle electrostatic repulsion. Moreover, the most compact interior structure formed within the micelle with the highest M-w. The p(r) plots show typical profiles yielded from some oblate ellipsoid with a small subunit, long rod with a limited cross-section dimension and flattened prolate ellipsoid.

A growing body of research suggests that having a disposition of gratitude is positively related to wellbeing and psychological adjustment. The present study examined the extent to which acceptance of illness-a measure of adjustment to a distressing condition-mediated relationships between dispositional gratitude and wellbeing among women who had elevated levels of depressive symptoms. MethodsParticipants were 131 women who, based on scores on the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale, were at-risk for experiencing clinical depression. Thirty-five of these participants had been diagnosed as depressed at some point in their lives and 96 had not. Participants completed measures of dispositional gratitude, wellbeing, anxiety, and acceptance of illness. ResultsDispositional gratitude was positively correlated with wellbeing and was negatively correlated with depression and anxiety. Dispositional gratitude was also positively correlated with acceptance of illness. Mediational analyses found that acceptance of illness mediated relationships between dispositional gratitude and wellbeing, between dispositional gratitude and anxiety, and between dispositional gratitude and depression. Moreover, such mediation varied as a function of whether women had ever been diagnosed as depressed. Acceptance of illness was related more strongly to wellbeing for women who had been diagnosed as depressed at some time in their lives than it was for women who had never been diagnosed as depressed. ConclusionWomen with elevated depressive symptoms who were more grateful (compared to those who were less grateful) were more accepting of their condition, which was related to increased wellbeing and decreased feelings of depression and anxiety.",0,0,Psychology

Previous studies have shown that the detection of exoplanetary rings in transit light curves is possible, albeit challenging. To aid such future detection of exoplanetary rings, we present the Polygon + Segments model for modelling the light curve of an exoplanet with rings. This high-precision model includes full ring geometry as well as possible ring transparency and the host star's limb darkening. It is also computationally efficient, requiring just a 1D integration over a small range, making it faster than existing techniques. The algorithm at its core is further generalized to compute the light curve of any set of convex primitive shapes in transit (e.g. multiple planets, oblate planets, moons, rings, combination thereof, etc.) while accounting for their overlaps.

PurposeAssuming that this cultural event is indicative of the openness of society towards menstruation, this study explores the cultural celebration of menarche and its various lesser-known details. It aims to find out the role of this celebration of menarche on adolescent girls' MH preparedness. Methods and approachA qualitative approach is used. In-depth interviews were conducted with well-informed community members to gather information on the historical background of this cultural event; interviews with some adolescent girls from the community to learn about their experiences of menstrual management and the impact of Tuloni Biya. FindingsThe main purpose of celebrating Tuloni Biya among the Assamese Hindu community is to announce when a girl reaches puberty because the celebration of the power of fertility gives girls and women the social status of being fertile, which the community regards as worthy of respect. Notwithstanding the lack of silence and secrecy about menstruation, the social taboo and stigma still remain. Assam continues to perform poorly in relation to MH, and the cultural celebration of menarche in Assam does not appear to have any significantly positive impact in this regard. Policy implicationsTuloni Biya could be used as a development tool for bringing constructive changes in MH preparedness in the community, for instance, by celebrating Tuloni Biya (cultural customs and rituals) and the celebration of menstruation (MH education and literacy); through knowledge-sharing sessions by teachers on the occasion of Tuloni Biya; arranging the gifts of kits for MH management from the Health Ministry of Assam on the occasion of Tuloni Biya; training of mothers by the public health system in how to use the opportunity of Tuloni Biya to equip their daughters with adequate information and guidance on MH.",0,0,Development Studies

This article investigates that problem by analysing daily metaphors as they are used in newspaper news story by employing cognitive framework. Based on the analysis of the various metaphors used in the news text, it is found that those metaphors are based on correlations with the bodily experience (as it appears in spatial metaphors) and a certain anthropomorphistic tendency (as it appears in personification).

The verbal expression is complemented during direct communication by paraverbal and nonverbal components. We communicate not only by what we say but also by tone, gesture, expression and the position of our body, that is, with all our being. Each person represents an ensemble of signs (look, gestures, facial expressions, attitude. etc.) which transmits a certain message to the receptor. As a result, the absence of the intention to communicate does not cancel communication. In its essence, communication means sharing, communion. The verb to communicate is a transitive one and it is used with a complement (somebody communicates something, about something etc.) The use of the reflexive intransitive verbal form (somebody communicates oneself by what one communicates) expresses the relation established between the subject of the communication and the act of communicating itself. Thus, the sender transmits information about something that is outside him but at the same time he also transmits information about himself. The specificity of didactic communication is given by the intentionality of the didactic language, by the existence of pre-established objectives and by the possibility to adapt the discourse according to feedback. Didactic communication involves two interlocutors precisely defined: on the one hand, the teacher, on the other hand, the pupils. Each one comes with one's own need to communicate, with one's convictions, beliefs and expectations. In what regards the learning circumstances, the main purpose of communication is to meet the need to learn. We may say that a successful didactic activity depends to a great extend on the success of the teacher-student communication. The talent with which the teacher approaches the student's need to learn, the gift one shows when one builds one's pedagogical discourse, the skills one shows when it comes to make information accessible according to the class level are only some of the solutions to an equation in which to communicate also means to form.",0,0,Education & Educational Research

We examined healthcare- and acculturation-related factors influencing Hepatitis B testing among U.S. Vietnamese. Methods Survey data of 100 U.S. Vietnamese attending health fairs/programs hosted by community-based organizations (2017-2018) were analyzed. Healthcare-related predictors included insurance and past 2-year checkup. Acculturation-related predictors included Vancouver Acculturation Index, percentage of lifetime in the U.S., and Vietnamese and English fluency. We conducted a multiple logistic regression controlling for age, sex, education, and household income. Results The sample was an average 37.5 years old and 61.6% female. Insurance coverage was reported by 83.0%. Average percentage of lifetime in the U.S. was 56.8%. Seventy percent reported having received Hepatitis B testing.

One field where quotation accuracy is needed is in the learning sciences given its impact on pedagogy. An integral article in pedagogical discussions surrounding how to teach at the college level is the meta-analysis on active learning by Freeman et al. The Freeman et al. meta-analysis compared active learning to traditional lecture in terms of its effects on student learning and has been important in national initiatives on STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) reform. Given its influence coupled with the impact quotation errors could have in scientific discourse, we used citation context analysis to analyze whether assertions in the citing text that related to the efficacy of lecture and active learning were supported by what was explicitly stated in the cited meta-analysis. Assertions were analyzed undersupported, unsupported, or irrelevant for purposes of study categories. The most prevalent supported category related to active learning being more effective than lecture; the most prevalent unsupported category related to the effectiveness of specific activities/approaches other than the general approach of active learning.

This study evaluates the impact of outreach through health channels on California Medicaid (Medi-Cal) quitline caller characteristics, trends, and reach. Study design: Longitudinal study. Setting/participants: Medi-Cal quitline callers. Intervention: Statewide outreach was conducted with health providers, Medi-Cal plans (all-house-hold mailings with tracking codes), and public health organizations (March 2012-July 2015). For incentives, Medi-Cal callers could ask for a $20 gift card; in September 2013, callers were offered free nicotine patches. Main outcome measures: Caller characteristics were compared with chi-square analyses, joinpoint analysis of call trends was performed accounting for Medi-Cal population growth, referral source among Medi-Cal and non-Medi-Cal callers was documented, and the annual percentage of the population reached who called the Helpline was calculated. Analyses were conducted 2016-2018. Results: Total Medi-Cal callers were 92,900, a 70% increase from prior annual averages: 12.4% asked for the financial incentive, 17.3% reported the mailing code, and 73.3% received nicotine patches while offered. Among the two thirds of callers who completed counseling, 15.5% asked for the financial incentive, and 13.6% reported the mailing code. A joinpoint analysis showed call trends increased 23% above expected for the Medi-Cal population growth after mailings to providers and members began, and decreased after outreach ended. Annual reach increased from 2.3% (95% CI=2.1, 2.6) in 2011 to peak at 4.5% (95% CI=3.6, 5.3) in 2014. Among subgroups with higher reach rates, some also had higher rates of asking for the financial incentive (African Americans, American Indian), reporting the tracking code (whites), or both (aged 45-64 years). Medi-Cal callers were more likely than non-Medi-Cal callers to report providers (32.3% vs 23.8%) and plans (19.7% vs 1.4%) as their referral source, and less likely to cite media (20.2% vs 44.4%,p<0.001). Conclusions: Statewide outreach through health channels incentivizing Medi-Cal members increased the utilization and reach of quitline services. (C) 2018 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.

The food provisioned by males during these courtship feedings (CFs) represents the key source of energy for the female during egg formation. Non-pair males may trade food for extra pair copulations (EPC) with females during extra pair courtship feeding (EPCF), while females may trade copulations for food with non-pair males to obtain additional resources. Because EPCs can be costly to the females, they are expected to behave in ways that will deceive non-pair males to obtain additional resources at no cost to themselves. We investigated EPCFs in whiskered terns Chlidonias hybrida breeding in food-rich conditions, on carp ponds in southern Poland. Almost all CFs (n=2751) took place during the female's fertile period and peaked just before clutch initiation. 10% of all CFs were performed by non-pair males. Females tried to obtain food from the non-pair male during 39% of EPCFs, by swindling (the female solicits a non-social male for copulation and tries to swindle food with no cloacal contact) or by snatching (the female tries to take the gift without engaging in copulation). In the remaining 61% of EPCFs, females did not react or chased the visiting male away. The probability of a female's obtaining food during EPCF was much higher (0.69, 95% CI: 0.47-0.85) if she swindled rather than snatched (0.08, 95% CI: 0.02-0.22). Only 0.7% of EPCFs were followed by EPCs. The high availability of food in the study area allows males to perform frequent EPCFs, despite the very low probability of obtaining EPCs. This is the first time that true deception' during EPCFs has been reported in birds: swindling females obtain food from non-pair males at no immediate detectable cost to themselves.",3,3,Zoology

A random selection of 35 clusters from 308 villages of Lahore were considered, and from each cluster, six chickens aged >2 months were selected. A total of 210 serum samples were collected and examined by the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test for specific antibodies against AIV subtypes H5, H7, and H9. Overall weighted seroprevalence for AIVs was 65.2% (95% CI: 55.6-74.8%), and for subtype H5, H7 & H9 was 6.9% (95% CI: 10.8-23.0%), 0% (95% CI: 0-1.7%), and 62.0% (95% CI: 52.2-71.8%) respectively. However, none of the samples were positive for H7. The average flock size was 17.3 birds, and the main purpose of keeping poultry was for eggs/meat (70.6%, 95% CI: 59.7-81.4). A majority of them were reared in a semi-caged system (83%, 95% CI: 74.5-91.3).

Individual differences in the growth and maturity may afford a performance advantage, clouding coaches and practitioners' perceptions regarding current ability and future potential. This may result in the exclusion of talented, yet less physically gifted athletes. Participants were 91 male (n=47) and female (n=44) elite British Junior tennis players, 8-17years of age (12.5 +/- 1.9years). Height and body mass were measured and compared to growth charts; hand-wrist radiographs were taken. Skeletal age (SA) was estimated with the Fels method and contrasted to chronological age (CA). Mean height and body mass of individual players ranged between the 50th and 90th centiles for age and sex. Females were advanced in SA relative to CA (0.3-0.89years.) from 8years. Males were average to delayed in maturation from 8 to 12years, but advanced in SA from 14 to 16years (0.75-1.23years).

Herein, well-controlled three-dimensional (3D) NS@NCCH tree-like core-shell microarrays grown on flexible and conductive Ni-plated carbon cloth (NPCC) are fabricated, with NiSe (NS) nanorods as the core and NiCo(CO3)(OH)(2) (NCCH) nanosheets as the shell. The dense NS nanorod core in situ grown on NPCC, as a highly conductive and robust support, promotes electron transport as well as hindering the agglomeration of NCCH nanosheets. The NCCH nanosheet shell with a high specific surface area provides a bridge to combine the fast diffusion of electrolyte ions and ionic accessibility to the overall electrode surface. The synergistic contributions from the NPCC substrate and the core-shell NS@NCCH microarrays together with the natural gift of a 3D tree-like architecture enable the NS@NCCH/NPCC electrode to exhibit a high capacity of 6.89 F cm(-2) (1642 F g(-1), 228 mA h g(-1)) at 4 mA cm(-2) and good rate performance. Furthermore, an assembled flexible all-solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor (FASSAS) based on the NS@NCCH/NPCC electrode retains an energy density of 53.8 W h kg(-1) at a high power density of 15 kW kg(-1) and exhibits excellent cycling stability with 91.5% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles.

Drawing on theoretical assumptions about the impact of corruption on the quality of the business environment, we explore possible determinants of perceived corruption. We argue that explaining the determinants of corruption perceptions could be a valuable input for creating effective anti-corruption policies. In the paper, we perform a detailed analysis on the case of Serbia, a transition country with relatively widespread corruption in the business environment. Using the non-parametric analysis of variance test, we examine the significance of differences in the perceived spread of corruption across a number of independent variables (regions, size of locality, industry, size, and years of operation). Specifying an ordered logistic regression model, we estimate the relation between corruption perceptions and a number of potential causes: frequencies of unofficial payments or gifts for different purposes, the impact that unofficial payments to public officials have on the business operations of the respondents, as well as attitudes of the respondents about the quality of the judicial system and political stability. We find that perceptions of corruption as an obstacle to business operations can be linked to the frequency of unofficial payments to deal with customs and taxes, as well as the impact of unofficial payments to local or regional government officials on business performance of the respondents. The results provide useful insights into what policy measures are necessary to reduce the level of corruption, as well as how the effects of such measures can be assessed.",4,4,Business & Economics

In this work, we report on an ecological and bio-inspired coating strategy by replicating leaf structures onto Si-based solar cells. Transparent photopolymer with leaf surface morphologies was tightly cured on Si slabs through a facile double transfer process. After bio-mimicked layer coverages, sunlight reflection drops substantially from more than 35% down to less than 20% once lotus leaf was employed as the master. Consequentially, 10.9% gain of the maximum powers of the photovoltaic is obtained. The leaf replicas inherited their masters' hydrophobicity which is resistant to acidic and basic conditions. Physically adhered dusts are easily removed by water rolling. Lightwave guidance mechanism among air-polymer-Si interfaces is explicated through optical simulations, while wettability through the morphological impacts on hydrophobic states. Taking advantages of varieties of foliage species and surface structures, the work is hoped to boost large-scale industrial designs and realizations of the bionic antireflective and superhydrophobic coating on future solar cells.",38,38,Energy & Fuels

The Tibetan medicine, a traditional medical system used in China, is currently being the focus of research towards the discovery of new effective drugs against several diseases. Based on the literature survey of Tibetan medicine monographs and drug standards, the Tibetan medicine, and Tibetan prescription used in the traditional Tibetan medical system, here, we summarise the methods indicated for DM treatment. In the Tibetan medical system, 56 types of Tibetan medicine and 25 Tibetan prescriptions were found for the treatment of DM. The most commonly used are Curcuma, Berberidis Cortex, and Carthami Flos. Their names, families, medicinal parts, phytochemical components, and pharmacological activities were described in detail in our research. These Tibetan medicines and prescriptions are valuable gifts from the Tibetan medicine to the world and may be the source of potential drugs for the treatment of DM. With the help of modern phytochemistry, pharmacology, metabonomics, and/or clinical trial methods, further research is needed to prove its medicinal value, identify bioactive components, elucidate potential mechanisms of action, and assess potential side effects or toxicity.

In 2003, all students enrolled in each of the nation's 12 high schools with gifted dance programs participated in a two-phase survey. The same participants were invited to take part in a follow-up survey 1 year later. In all, 583 persons completed the phase 1 questionnaire survey, and 245 persons completed interviews twice at baseline and follow-up. Thirty-five females had a newly developed ED, and less than half of the ED cases found at baseline had recovered at follow-up. Being a grade 12 student carried a reduced risk of EDs, whereas higher baseline scores on the Bulimic Investigatory Test Edinburgh (BITE) increased risks of developing an ED after 1 year. A 10-item BITE questionnaire validly identified girl dance students who would develop EDs later in high school. EDs were more commonly developed during middle adolescence, and we suggest that prevention work against EDs begin in this period among the dance student population. The brief screening questionnaire might help detect intervention targets of a prevention program among adolescent dance students. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",2,2,Psychiatry

The Palestinian presence in Lebanon dates from 1948 and they remain a marginalized population. No information on their food security status has been reported previously. A survey of a representative sample of Palestinian refugee households in Lebanon (n = 2501) was conducted using a stratified two stage cluster sampling approach. We measured food insecurity using a modified USDA household food security module, locally validated. We collected data on household demographic, socioeconomic, health, housing, coping strategies and household intake of food groups and analysed these by food security status. About 41% (CI: 39-43) of households reported being food insecure and 20% (CI: 18-22) severely food insecure. Poor households were more likely to be severely food insecure (OR 1.41 (1.06-1.86)) while higher education of the head of household was significantly associated with protection against severe food insecurity (OR 0.66 (0.52-0.84)). Additionally, higher food expenditure and possession of food-related assets were significantly associated with food security (OR 0.93 (0.89-0.97) and OR 0.74 (0.59-0.92), respectively). After adjusting for confounders, households where at least one member suffered from an acute illness remained significantly more likely to be severely food insecure (OR 1.31(1.02-1.66)), as were households whose proxy respondent reported poor mental health (OR 2.64 (2.07-3.38)) and poor self-reported health (OR 1.62 (1.22-2.13). Severely food insecure households were more likely to eat cheaper foods when compared to non-severely food insecure households (p<0.001) and were more likely to rely on gifts (p<0.001) or welfare (p<0.001). They were also more likely to have exhausted all coping strategies, indicating significantly more frequently that they could not do anything (p = 0.0102). Food insecurity is a significant problem among Palestinian refugees in Lebanon and is likely to be exacerbated at this time when the Syrian crisis amplifies the problem.",25,25,Science & Technology - Other Topics

As foreign NGO staff lament patriarchal norms that supposedly leave orphaned girls culturally and economically ill-equipped to refuse advances from older men, these organizations seek new ways to liberate orphans from underage sexual relationships. I trace how one NGO attempted to render sugar daddies unnecessary by directly giving girls the gifts a boyfriend would provide, drawing on human rights and empowerment discourses. However, many orphans began to appropriate these NGO resources in order to attract even wealthier boyfriends, aggressively pursuing age-unequal relationships using the very tools the NGO provided to fight them. While tales of failed intervention are commonly represented in development studies as evidence of either culture clash between foreign aid and local customs, or as the unintended consequences of aid, this article argues that such explanations fail to address the competing and coalescing moralities that motivated the girls' behavior. By recognizing their actions as efforts to manipulate multiple moral codes that are at play during the HIV epidemic, I suggest that we may reach a better grasp of the inner lives of aid's targets and gain fresh perspectives on the intimate sociopolitical effects of intervention.",13,13,Development Studies; International Relations; Government & Law

Traditional media has changed, and now exists alongside and within an instantaneous, interactive sharing of information created and controlled by anyone; the way most people use it today incorporates a wide variety of online communication media. Polymedia describes media communication as both a product and process, where anyone can contribute and act as producers, consumers, audiences, and critics. In a Polymediated age, media exposure becomes much more complex. To understand how media exposure to suicide influences and impacts on others, it is important to take into account the communicative ecology of media technologies and the different interactions we can have with them. We researched the effects of this type of exposure by conducting in-depth interviews with a purposive sample of individuals who have lived experience and/or knowledge of suicide exposure via polymediated communication in the aftermath of a suicide. Using thematic analysis, our data demonstrates how exposure to suicide has become more complex as a result of new communicative media technology: it can be both a gift and a curse, difficult to distinguish, predict or control. Polymedia has the power to determine new forms of narrative and new forms of behaviour that on the one hand can provide support and prevention efforts, while on the other hand can promote conflict and cast an adverse influence on suicidal behaviour. Polymedia provides novel affordances for very intimate collective exposure to suicide. Our findings shed important new light on how the interplay between news media and social media has transformed our relationship with the information to which we're exposed. We highlight important suggestions for those working in suicide prevention to develop (1) media strategies that recognise the multiple ways in which users are exposed and impacted, and (2) mechanisms for a strategic amplification and moderation of specific types of content. Media organisations and users of social media alike can contribute to maximising the beneficial capacity of polymediated exposure to suicide.",1,1,Psychology

However, the micellar core radius remains essentially the same, i.e., the growth is one dimensional. The increasing tendency of zero-shear viscosity, eta(0), with the chain length of oil further confirmed the micellar growth. The relative viscosity, eta(r), of the reverse micelles was higher and exhibited a steeper solvent (chain length) dependence behavior than those predicted for a dispersion of spherical particles based on the Krieger-Dougherty relation sustaining the SAXS results.

The C8F17EO20 forms micelles and different liquid crystal phases depending on the temperature and composition. The fluorocarbon micellar structure induced by temperature or composition change and added fluorocarbon cosurfactant has been systematically studied. The SAXS data were analyzed by the indirect Fourier transformation (IFF) and the generalized indirect Fourier transformation (GIFT) depending on the volume fraction of the surfactant and complemented by plausible model calculations. The C8F17EO20 forms spherical type micelles above critical micelle concentration (cmc) in the dilute region. The micelle tends to grow with temperature; however, the growth is not significant on changing temperature from 15-75 degrees C, which is attributed to the higher clouding temperature of the surfactant (> 100 degrees C). On the other hand, the micellar structure (shape and size) is apparently unaffected by composition (1-25 wt %) at 25 degrees C. Nevertheless, addition of fluorocarbon cosurfactant of structure C8F17SO2N(C3H7)(CH2CH2O)H (abbreviated as C8F17EO1) to the semidilute solution of C8F17EO20 (25 wt %) favors micellar growth, which finally leads to the formation of viscoelastic wormlike micelles, as confirmed by rheometry and supported by SAXS. The onset sphere-to-wormlike transition in the structure of micelles in the C8F17EO20/water/C8F17EO1 system is due to the fact that the C8F17EO1 tends to go to the surfactant palisade layer so that the critical packing parameter increases due to a decrease in the effective cross-sectional area of the headgroup. As a result, spherical micelles grow into a cylinder, which after a certain concentration entangle to form a rigid network structure of wormlike micelles.",24,25,Chemistry

We therefore studied the level of PI interactions and the underlying beliefs and attitudes in a large sample of European psychiatric trainees. Methods: One thousand four hundred and forty-four psychiatric trainees in 20 European countries were assessed cross-sectionally, with a 62-item questionnaire. Results: The total number of PI interactions in the preceding two months varied between countries, with least interactions in The Netherlands (M (Mean) = 0.92, SD = 1.44, range = 0-12) and most in Portugal (M = 19.06, SD = 17.44, range = 0-100). Trainees were more likely to believe that PI interactions have no impact on their own prescribing behaviour than that of other physicians (M = 3.30, SD = 1.26 vs. M = 2.39, SD = 1.06 on a 5-point Likert scale: 1 completely disagree'' to 5 completely agree''). Assigning an educational role to the pharmaceutical industry was associated with more interactions and higher gift value (IRR (incidence rate ratio) = 1.21, 95% CI = 1.12-1.30 and OR = 1.18, 95% CI = 1.02-1.37). Conclusions: There are frequent interactions between European psychiatric trainees and the PI, with significant variation between countries. We identified several factors affecting this interaction, including attribution of an educational role to the PI. Creating alternative educational opportunities and specific training dedicated to PI interactions may therefore help to reduce the impact of the PI on psychiatric training.

The micellar shape and size remained essentially the same despite a wide variation in surfactant concentration (5 to 30%) but an opposite trend was observed with the rise of temperature; size decreased by approximately 25% with increase in temperature from 25 to 75 degrees C. Addition of traces water favored micellar growth and eventually ellipsoid prolate type micelles were formed, whose scenario is understood in terms of decrease in the critical packing parameter (cpp); water hydrates the surfactant's headgroup and decreases cpp. At a particular concentration of water, increasing temperature decreased the micellar size due to dehydration of headgroup. It is interesting to note that size of 1.57% water incorporated micelle is approximately 2.5 times bigger than the empty micelles.",6,6,Chemistry; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Materials Science; Physics

This knowledge assists in the efforts to reduce the impact of their interactions with the pharmaceutical industry on clinical practice. It appears that most studies on such perceptions and attitudes have been conducted in high-income countries. The objective was to systematically review the knowledge, beliefs and attitudes of physicians in low and middle-income countries regarding interactions with pharmaceutical companies. Methods: Eligible studies addressed any type of interaction between physicians and pharmaceutical companies. The outcomes of interest included knowledge, beliefs and attitudes of practicing physicians. The search strategy covered MEDLINE and EMBASE databases. Two reviewers completed in duplicate and independently study selection, data abstraction, and assessment of methodological features. The data synthesis consisted of a narrative summary of the findings stratified by knowledge, beliefs and attitudes. Results: We included ten reports from nine eligible studies, each of which had a number of methodological limitations. Four studies found that the top perceived benefits of this interaction were receiving information and rewards. In five out of eight studies assessing the perception regarding the impact of the interaction on the behavior of physician prescription, the majority of participants believed it to be minor. In one of these studies, participants perceived that impact to be lesser when asked about their own behavior. The attitudes of physicians towards information and rewards provided by pharmaceutical company representatives (PCRs) ( assessed in 5 and 2 studies respectively) varied across studies. In the only study assessing their attitudes towards pharmaceutical-sponsored Continuing Medical Education, physicians considered local conferences to have higher impact. Their attitudes towards developing policies restricting physicians' interactions with PCRs were positive in two studies. In one study, the majority of participants did not mind the public knowing that physicians were receiving gifts and awards from drug companies. Conclusions: This review identified few studies conducted in low and middle-income countries. While physicians generally perceived the impact of interactions on their behavior to be minor, their attitudes toward receiving information and rewards varied across studies.",21,21,Health Care Sciences & Services

Based on our observations of industrial practices, we establish stylized analytical models for a supply chain consisting of a luxury brand (supplier) and a retailer. In addition, we explore the consequences of preordering for the supply chain, its members, and conspicuous consumers. Results show that preordering information incentivizes the retailer to increase product scarcity and leverage consumers' conspicuous consumption to charge a premium retail price, which consequently allows the supplier to increase the wholesale price. However, preordering information updating may have negative effects on the retailer due to the increased wholesale price, but this case always benefits the supplier. We recognize that preordering has two effects, aservice-extending effectand aprecision-improving effect, which positively and negatively affect consumers, respectively. Thus, retailers offering the preorder services should provide consumers with incentives (e.g., gifts or coupons) to achieve an all-win scenario with preordering information updating. This finding is consistent with widely observed industrial practices in e-commerce. In addition, our numerical studies interestingly show that all supply chain members can benefit from an increase in the level of conspicuous consumption in the market.",21,21,Business & Economics

Usually these studies are carried out on expeditions but not longitudinally. The aim of this study is to describe physiological and kinanthropometrical changes over the time in a top-level climber. Material/Methods: This is a single-subject study on an individual career part (from ages 27 to 41). Some physiological and kinanthropometrical parameters were analysed in 3 different season parts at sea level; before (PRE), after (POST) and off climbing expeditions (OFF). All expeditions were >7000 m. Results: No changes were found in physiological parameters during the period of study regarding to season part. Kinanthropometry in contrast, presented significant changes (P<0.01) in two skinfolds (PRE/OFF vs. POST), whereas Sigma of SF showed differences between (PRE vs. OFF). Results also indicate some significant correlations (P<0.05) between both kinanthropometrical and physiological variables and the participant aging process. Conclusions: The high fitness level of the participant combined with his gift for acclimatization and a broad climbing career, maintain physiological and kinanthropometrical stability during the analysed period even after repeated exposure to extreme altitudes. However, aging process appears to be involved in maximal exercise cardiovascular capacity decline. Surprisingly, kinanthropometrical variables such as weight, BMI and fat percentage showed lower values through the time attributable probably to a high physical activity.",1,1,Sport Sciences

PS-b-P4VP was coupled with DR1 in 10 mg/mL toluene/ethanol mixture solutions where ethanol and toluene were P4VP and PS selective, respectively. Hydrogen bonds were formed between the -OH group of DR1 and the pyridine ring in PS-b-P4VP. DR1 (which was coupled with P4VP) was confined in the core or corona of the micelle depending on the location of P4VP. The micellar structure was strongly dependent on 0 (weight percentage of toluene in a toluene/ethanol mixture). The PS-b-P4VP-DR1 complex in the mixture solutions showed the spherical micelle with the cores of P4VP and PS in ethanol-rich and toluene-rich solvents, respectively. The quenching phenomenon was observed for DR1 in the corona of PS-b-P4VP micelles [at phi = 0 (ethanol)], while the fluorescence quantum yield decreased. However, significant increases in the fluorescence quantum yields at 0 = 100 were observed when DR1 was confined in the core of the PS-b-P4VP micelles. The confinement of DR1 in the hard core was more effective in fluorescence emission than that in the soft corona due to the slow trans-to-cis transition of DR1.",8,8,Chemistry; Materials Science

In industrialized countries, empirical studies have indicated the link between grandparents' educational attainment vis-a-vis their caregiving roles and the social-emotional development of grandchildren. Such findings call for further investigation especially from the perspective of a developing country with a collectivist culture such as the Philippines. Here, the vital role of grandparents is highly recognized and appreciated. This study argues that the grandparent who is a professional educator significantly contributes to the positive social-emotional development of grandchildren, hence this phenomenological inquiry. A semi-structured interview was employed as the main data gathering tool. Field texts were subjected to vertical and horizontal analyses to abstract the essence of the phenomenon and were validated through member checking procedures and critical friend technique.

Its difference distribution table (DDT) and linear approximation table (LAT) affect the security of the cipher against differential and linear cryptanalysis. In most previous work, differential uniformity and linearity of an S-box are two primary cryptographic properties to impact the resistance against differential and linear attacks. In some cases, the branch number and fixed point are also be considered. However, other important cryptographic properties such as the frequency of differential uniformity (resp. linearity) and the number of Bad Input and Bad Output (BIBO) patterns in DDT (resp. LAT) are often ignored. These properties substantially affect lightweight cryptography based on substitution bit permutation networks (SbPN) such as PRESENT, GIFT and RECTANGLE. This paper introduces a new method to search for S-boxes satisfying all above criteria simultaneously. In our strategy, we transform the process of searching for S-boxes under certain constraints on cryptographic properties into a satisfiability (SAT) problem. As applications, we use our new approach to search out 4-bit and 5-bit S-boxes with the same or better cryptographic properties compared with the S-boxes from well-known ciphers. Finally, we also utilize our method to verify a conjecture proposed by Boura et al. in the case of all 3-bit and 4-bit S-boxes.

The study area is gifted with fertile agricultural land that is blessed with arid and semi-arid climatic conditions. However, uncultivated landscapes in the region are occupied by wild flora including wild edible fruits. This work focused on the consumers of wild edible fruits in the indigenous communities because of their vast traditional knowledge on the nutritional importance of indigenous wild species. A total of 27 wild edible fruit plants were recorded in the area belonging to 16 families. All the plants were native and have occupied the area for decades or centuries. Ziziphus nummularia, Morus nigra and Morus alba were found to be the most abundant and consumable species. The most rarely occurring species were Asparagus officinalis, Cocculus hirsutus, Cordia gharaf and Grewia tenax. The plant samples were collected, identified, preserved and deposited in the Herbarium of University of Sargodha (SARGU) for future reference. Fruit samples were subjected to proximate analysis such as moisture, crude protein, crude fat, crude fiber, ash and nitrogen free extract (NFE) contents to evaluate their nutritional importance. Moisture content, crude protein, crude fat, crude fiber, ash and NFE ranged from 9.36 to 84.05%, 0.18 to 3.68%, 0.12 to 5.46%, 0.32 to 45.43%, 0.17 to 19.68% and 32.52 to 99.03% respectively.

However, recent findings have claimed that exceptional intelligence may come at a cost. Individuals at the upmost end of the intelligence distribution are reported to be disproportionately afflicted by a set of stress-related physical and mental health conditions: so-called overexcitabilities. Few accounts have investigated this issue and no studies are available for non-US samples yet. Here, we aimed to replicate and extend previous work by examining hitherto unaddressed overexcitabilities in a European high-IQ sample. Methods: We carried out a preregistered survey among members of MENSA, the world's largest high-IQ society. In total, 615 (307 male) members from Austria, Germany, Hungary, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom participated.

Contrary to previous accounts, neither asthma, allergies, nor autoimmune diseases were elevated. We show that this subsample of intellectually gifted persons faces specific health challenges compared to the general population. The reasons for this remain speculative, as we find little evidence for previously proposed immunological explanations. However, it is possible that the effects are caused by sample selectiveness (i.e., membership in a high-IQ society) rather than high IQ itself.",0,0,Psychology

Many researchers have claimed that LS-MIMO systems increase energy efficiency (EE) and bandwidth efficiency (BE) exponentially because of large number of antennas. Significant increase in transmission directivity also increases sum rate and data throughput but implementation of LS-MIMO is complex in terms of hardware. As the number of antenna elements increase, it becomes necessary that the manufacturing material of antenna must be very cheap and size of antenna element should be very compact. Large number of antenna elements and other hardware components induce different impairments in the system due to amplifier distortion, quantization noise, and phase noise. Since these impairments come as a gift with large scale antenna regime and they effect EE and BE of the system, it is necessary to investigate them for practical scenarios.

In this study, we described a triple-responsive oil-in-water Pickering emulsion that was stabilized by amphiphilic core cross-linked supramolecular polymer particles (CCSPs). For this purpose, beta-cyclodextrin-terminated poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM-beta-CD) and azobenzene-capped poly(4-vinylpyridine) (P4VP-azo) were separately synthesized by reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer polymerization. By virtue of the inclusion interaction between the beta-CD host and the azobenzene guest in dimethyl sulfoxide, the amphiphilic supramolecular block copolymer, poly(4-vinylpyridine)-b-poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (P4VP-b-PNIPAM), was formed. CCSPs were prepared through the combination of the self-assembly of P4VP-b-PNIPAM in the selective solvent, water, and the cross-linking of the P4VP core with 1,4-dibromobutane. Due to thermoresponsiveness of PNIPAM shells and the supramolecular linkages between the cross-linked hydrophobic P4VP core and hydrophilic PNIPAM shells, the as-prepared CCSPs exhibited temperature-, light-, and amantadine hydrochloride guest-triggered morphological transitions. Such triple-responsive morphological transitions gifted CCSPs stabilized oil-in-water Pickering emulsion with flexible demulsification in response to various factors, such as thermo, light, and amantadine hydrochloride or their combinations.

Consequently, food and beverages high in fat, salt and sugar (HFSS), detrimental to oral and wider health, make unrestricted appearances. The study aim was to assess the amount of HFSS food and drink children are exposed to while reading magazines; with particular focus on foods containing free sugars due to their known cariogenic properties, and foods with low pH due to their erosive potential. Design Eleven of the most popular UK children's magazines were selected and purchased at four separate time points in 2012. These 44 magazines were examined using content analysis; any references to food/beverages (in advertisements, free gifts, editorial and general content) were recorded. Results Of the 508 food references observed, 73.6% (374/508) were for foods detrimental to oral health owing to their high sugar and/or acid content. 5.9% (30/508) were considered 'unhealthy' due to their fat or salt content. 20.5% of references were for 'healthy' foods (104/508). The most common food categories referenced were baked goods (181/508) and sweets (86/508). Over a third (36.4%, 16/44) of magazines came with free sweets. In terms of positioning, the food/drink references were predominantly found in the general content of the magazines, including the editorial spreads. Direct advertisements for food/drink only accounted for 9.6% (36/374) of the total number of references counted. Conclusion Food references within children's magazines are biased towards unhealthy foods especially those detrimental to oral health; these permeate throughout the general and editorial content and are not restricted to direct advertisements. Magazine editors, journalists and illustrators are responsible for the editorial and general content of magazines. Without regulation, subliminal placement of advertisements within editorial and general content leads to 'advertorials' which are known to confuse children and parents alike. This study concludes that regulation may therefore need to cover more than just the direct advertisements.

Few quantitative studies based on nationally representative survey data explored the relationship between sexual behaviors, HIV infection, and transactional sex. Objective: This study aimed to determine the associations between risky sexual behaviors, participation in transactional sex, and HIV sero-status among men and women aged 15-24 in Uganda. Design: The study uses data from the Uganda AIDS Indicator Survey, a cross-sectional national HIV serological study conducted in 2011. We analyzed data on 1,516 men and 2,824 women aged 15-24 who had been sexually active in the 12 months preceding the survey. Private, face-to-face interviews were also conducted to record the sociodemographics, sexual history, and experiences of sexual coercion. Logistic regression analysis was performed to measure associations between sexual behaviors and transactional sex, and associations between HIV sero-status and transactional sex. Results: Among young people who had been sexually active in the 12 months prior to the survey, 5.2% of young men reported paying for sex while 3.7% of young women reported receiving gifts, favors, or money for sex. Lower educational attainment (ORadjusted 3.25, CI 1.10-9.60) and experience of sexual coercion (ORadjusted 2.83, CI 1.07-7.47) were significantly associated with paying for sex among men. Multiple concurrent sexual relationships were significantly associated with paying for sex among young men (ORadjusted 5.60, CI 2.08-14.95) and receiving something for sex among young women (ORadjusted 8.04, CI 2.55-25.37). Paying for sex among young men and having three to five lifetime sexual partners among young women were associated with increased odds of testing positive for HIV. Conclusions: Transactional sex is associated with sexual coercion and HIV risk behaviors such as multiple concurrent sexual partnerships among young people in Uganda. In addition, transactional sex appears to place young men at increased risk for HIV in Uganda. Both sexes appear equally vulnerable to risks associated with transactional sex, and therefore should be targeted in intervention programs. In addition, strengthening universal education policy and improving school retention programs may be beneficial in reducing risky sexual behaviors and transactional sex.",47,47,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"

Black soldier flies, Hermetia illucens, are a suitable model to investigate the trade-offs between reproduction and longevity as they largely rely on their larval resources and do not have to feed as adults. Here, we investigated the influence of mating status on adult longevity. We found that females had shorter longevity than males, but the intersexual difference in life span was reduced through mating which increased female but decreased male longevity. This suggests a cost of mating for males, while female longevity increased, likely via nutrients transferred by males during copulation (sensu nuptial gifts). We also investigated the transparent abdominal 'window' of adult black soldier flies, the fullness of which may be a proxy for both age and mating status. Window fullness decreased with age in unmated males whereas unmated females maintained high fullness until they were older. Additionally, mated females mostly had full windows while those of mated males were mostly empty. Our findings have not only expanded our understanding of resource allocation in this species, but they also harbour great potential for applicability in the industrial sector given the extensive use of black soldier flies in organic waste management.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

Many activities of Serbian citizens were limited or completely stopped. Citizens had to spend most of their time confined in their homes. However, some still wanted and managed to acquire pets. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine which kinds of pets (dogs, cats and non-traditional animals) the residents of Serbia acquired during the first year of the COVID 19 pandemic and in which manner (purchase, adoption or gift). If the pets were acquired by adoption, the participants were asked from what sources they adopted them. Finally, how the characteristics of the owner and their household influenced the adoption of pets was examined. A total of 566 pet owners who acquired pets in the pre-COVID 19 and COVID 19 periods participated in the research. The COVID pandemic reduced the number of pet owners 2.7-fold in 2020 compared to 2019. Dogs were the most favourite pets acquired before (43%) and during (43%) the pandemic. During the pandemic, 61% of pets were acquired by adoption and the percentage of dogs, cats and non-traditional pets adopted directly from previous owners increased by 32%, 13% and 12%, respectively. The probability of acquiring pets by adoption was significantly increased by the presence of people older than 65 in the household (OR=2.56; P=0.02), the absence of children up to 5 years of age (OR=0.17; P<0.001) in the household, lower monthly incomes (OR=0.47; P<0.001), the greater available free time of the owner (OR=2.09; P<0.001), and the period of adoption (OR=2.42; P<0.001).

However, the ability to solve applied math problems is associated with academic achievement, everyday problem-solving abilities, and vocational outcomes. The paucity of research on math achievement in ASD may be partly explained by the widely-held belief that most individuals with ASD are mathematically gifted, despite emerging evidence to the contrary. The purpose of the study was twofold: to assess the relative proportions of youth with ASD who demonstrate giftedness versus disability on applied math problems, and to examine which cognitive (i.e., perceptual reasoning, verbal ability, working memory) and clinical (i.e., test anxiety) characteristics best predict achievement on applied math problems in ASD relative to typically developing peers. Twenty-seven high-functioning adolescents with ASD and 27 age- and Full Scale IQ-matched typically developing controls were assessed on standardized measures of math problem solving, perceptual reasoning, verbal ability, and test anxiety. Results indicated that 22% of the ASD sample evidenced a mathematics learning disability, while only 4% exhibited mathematical giftedness. The parsimonious linear regression model revealed that the strongest predictor of math problem solving was perceptual reasoning, followed by verbal ability and test anxiety, then diagnosis of ASD. These results inform our theories of math ability in ASD and highlight possible targets of intervention for students with ASD struggling with mathematics. Autism Res2016, 9: 480-490.

However, the detailed features are hidden since the ions insertion into WO3 is a very complex process including structural deformation and phase transformations. Chronopotentiometry is an electrochemical characterization method that measures the response potential of a system under an imposed current. Compared to other dynamic characterization methods (impedance spectroscopy and CV), it allows direct access to the voltage contributions in different states of the solution-electrode system and has frequently been used to investigate kinetic effects such as adsorption and transport phenomena near electrode surface. In this study, chronopotentiometry is creatively applied to study ion transport kinetics and control ions insertion behavior in electrochromic WO3 film. The results suggest that a large ions insertion flux at the interface of WO3/electrolyte could broaden ions transport channels due to the fierce lattice expansion during Li+ ions insertion process, which further improves the ions transportation kinetics and gifts a fast switching speed of optical performance. However, the repeating ions insertion/extraction behaviors at the interface of WO3/electrolyte for the long-term cycle process can reduce the size of WO3 grains as a ball mill effect. Especially, a large ions transport flux can aggravate the ball mill effect. Consequently, the structure of the WO3 film becomes very dense, which is unfavorable for ions transport and electrolyte permeation. This dense structure also leads to an irreversible accumulation of Li+ ions and LixWO3 in the WO3 host structure, resulting in a decay of optical modulation ability and electrochromic activity. This work offers an efficient method to analyze ion transport kinetics in intercalation materials and a new understanding of the relationship between ion transport behavior and cyclic stability of electrochromic materials.",4,4,Materials Science

Four stimulated recall interviews were conducted with a sample of secondary school teachers (n = 4) in the Netherlands. We found that teachers' interactive cognitions varied depending on the context. More specifically, it appeared that in the talent lessons, teachers focused more on small groups or on individual students than they did in the regular lessons. Also, regardless of context, teachers often take student characteristics into account, but how they do this varies among teachers.

Major purpose of Taoist music is to preach sermons and it is also used as lyric music in Taoist ceremonies which is beneficial to self-cultivation. The style of folk Taoist music is extraordinarily refined, and this is closely related to mediation of music in Taoist thoughts. The emergence of Taoist music can be contributed to sacrificial ceremonies and activities in ancient times of China, and it was deeply influenced by witchcraft culture. Therefore, rhythms and postures of dancing have become prototypes of folk Taoist music of China especially west-Chongqing areas, and functions as well as aesthetic connotations of folk Taoist music also changed accordingly in the process of development for a long time. Taoism inherited the thoughts of Taoist schools, thus folk Taoist music was also inevitably influenced by this kind of religious culture. As a result, analysis of aesthetic thoughts and styles can help people deeply explore the connotations of Taoist music and Taoist thoughts. Besides, music forms, contents, styles and essence are influenced by artistic and aesthetic spirit of Taoism, hence Taoist music is also the embodiment of artistic and aesthetic spirit in the art of music at the same time. Therefore, this paper mainly makes an analysis of music forms and aesthetic connotations of folk Taoist music in west-Chongqing areas with the aim to provide people a better comprehension of Taoist music in Chinese traditional history and culture. At first, In the west of chongqing folk Taoism music basic form by the vocal melody and gongs and drums of classic paragraph. Then, Part of vocal music is made up of hymns, aria and recitative. In the west of chongqing folk Taoist classic music vocal passages have suffering, miao yan palace, Taoism carols of the triple gem, ode of the oven, for the soul,  the spell of the throat, ode back to the altar, libation, and so on.

Consequently, food and beverages high in fat, salt and sugar (HFSS), detrimental to oral and wider health, make unrestricted appearances. The study aim was to assess the amount of HFSS food and drink children are exposed to while reading magazines; with particular focus on foods containing free sugars due to their known cariogenic properties, and foods with low pH due to their erosive potential. Design Eleven of the most popular UK children's magazines were selected and purchased at four separate time points in 2012. These 44 magazines were examined using content analysis; any references to food/beverages (in advertisements, free gifts, editorial and general content) were recorded. Results Of the 508 food references observed, 73.6% (374/508) were for foods detrimental to oral health owing to their high sugar and/or acid content. 5.9% (30/508) were considered 'unhealthy' due to their fat or salt content. 20.5% of references were for 'healthy' foods (104/508). The most common food categories referenced were baked goods (181/508) and sweets (86/508). Over a third (36.4%, 16/44) of magazines came with free sweets. In terms of positioning, the food/drink references were predominantly found in the general content of the magazines, including the editorial spreads. Direct advertisements for food/drink only accounted for 9.6% (36/374) of the total number of references counted. Conclusion Food references within children's magazines are biased towards unhealthy foods especially those detrimental to oral health; these permeate throughout the general and editorial content and are not restricted to direct advertisements. Magazine editors, journalists and illustrators are responsible for the editorial and general content of magazines. Without regulation, subliminal placement of advertisements within editorial and general content leads to 'advertorials' which are known to confuse children and parents alike. This study concludes that regulation may therefore need to cover more than just the direct advertisements. Dental professionals need to be aware of current trends in children's media when giving health education advice or designing health promotion initiatives.",0,0,"Dentistry, Oral Surgery & Medicine"

Our store-choice model enables us to evaluate the effects of the consumer/product attributes not only on the consumer's store choice but also on his/her purchase quantity. Moreover, we adopt a mixed-integer optimization (MIO) approach to selecting the best set of explanatory variables with which to construct the store-choice model. We devise two MIO models for hierarchical variable selection in which the hierarchical structure of product categories is used to enhance the reliability and computational efficiency of the variable selection. We assess the effectiveness of our MIO models through computational experiments on actual scanner panel data. These experiments are focused on the consumer's choice among three types of stores in Japan: convenience stores, drugstores, and (grocery) supermarkets. The computational results demonstrate that our method has several advantages over the common methods for variable selection, namely, the stepwise method and -regularized regression. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that convenience stores are most strongly chosen for gift cards and garbage disposal permits, drugstores are most strongly chosen for products that are specific to drugstores, and supermarkets are most strongly chosen for health food products by women with families.",2,2,Mathematics

Today, mobile phones have infinite resources that have multiple benefits and applications. Its excessive use may impact adolescents in the form of behavioral changes and diminish the academic performance. This study explores the relationship between mobile phone usage with behavioral modifications and educational achievement among adolescents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A descriptive correlational study was conducted among adolescents (n = 285 -male-210, female-75) at selected schools of Rishikesh, Uttarakhand, India. The test of mobile dependence was used to assess the mobile phone dependence, and a behavioral Likert scale to evaluate the behavioral changes through the self-report method. The academic performance was observed by school records; percentage of the last two examination results was considered. Collected data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. RESULTS: The study shows that 156 (54.70%) participants had a low mobile dependency, 191 (67%) participants had negative behavioral changes, and 125 (43.90%) participants had shown reduced academic performance due to overuse of the mobile phone. A significant relationship was seen between mobile phone dependency with behavioral changes (P < 0.001) and academic achievement (P < 0.035) seen among adolescents.

Understanding the commodity chain of wild animals (hunting, transportation, trade, consumption) can help target conservation initiatives. Wild meat commodity chain research has focused on the formal trade and less on informal enterprises, although informal enterprises contribute to a large portion of the wild meat trade in sub-Saharan Africa. We aimed to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the formal and informal components of these commodity chains by focusing on the mammalian wild meat trade in Madagascar. Our objectives were to: (1) identify hunting strategies used to capture different wild mammals; (2) analyze patterns of movement of wild meat from the capture location to the final consumer; (3) examine wild meat prices, volumes, and venues of sale; and (4) estimate the volume of wild meat consumption. Data were collected in May-August 2013 using semi-structured interviews with consumers (n = 1343 households, 21 towns), meat-sellers (n = 520 restaurants, open-air markets stalls, and supermarkets, 9 towns), and drivers of inter-city transit vehicles (n = 61, 5 towns). We found that: (1) a wide range of hunting methods were used, though prevalence of use differed by animal group; (2) wild meat was transported distances of up to 166 km to consumers, though some animal groups were hunted locally (< 10 km) in rural areas; (3) most wild meat was procured from free sources (hunting, gifts), though urban respondents who consumed bats and wild pigs were more likely to purchase those meats; and (4) wild meat was consumed at lower rates than domestic meat, though urban respondents consumed wild meat twice as much per year compared to rural respondents.

However, many varied barriers to LARC placement are reported. Medical education and training can be tailored if there is a better understanding of how barriers predict LARC referral and to predicting LARC placement. Objective: To understand how a variety of key barriers to LARC placement are related to one another; to identify which of the barriers, when considered simultaneously, predict LARC referral and LARC placement; and to assess the barriers to LARC placement that persist, even when a major barrier, training, is removed. Methods: We recruited providers (obstetricians and gynecologists, family physicians, pediatricians, internal medicine physicians, certified nurse practitioners, and certified nurse midwives) across the state of Ohio. Participants were compensated with a $35 Amazon gift card for completing an online survey comprising 38 Likert-type items, an 11-item knowledge test, LARC placement and referral questions, and demographic questions. We conducted data analyses that included correlations, odds ratios, and independent samples t tests. Results: A total of 224 providers participated in the study. Long-acting reversible contraception knowledge, training, and provider concerns were correlated with one another. Training was found to positively predict placement and negatively predict referral when other barriers, such as knowledge and provider concerns, were considered simultaneously. Of providers who were trained to place implants, 18.6% (n=16) said they referred implant placement, and 17.4% (n=15) said they did not place implants. Of providers who were trained to place IUDs, 26.3% (n=26) said they referred IUD placement, and 27.3% (n=27) said they did not place IUDs. Those who referred placement and those who did not place LARCs reported greater barriers (in type and magnitude) to LARC placement than those who did place LARCs.

The aim of the study was to examine preparation of pediatric patients to allow smooth performance of PBT. Material and methods: Preparation was initiated 1-2 days before treatment planning CT and continued for 10 days. The patient first visited the facility to become familiar with the treatment room and staff. As the second step, the patient stayed in the treatment bed for a certain time with their mother, and then stayed on the treatment bed alone. Special fixtures painted with characters, music, and gifts were also prepared. Results: From 2010 to 2014, 111 pediatric patients underwent PBT. These patients were divided into 3 groups: 40 who could follow instructions well (group A, median age: 13.6 years old), 60 who could communicate, but found it difficult to stay alone for a long time (group B, median age: 4.6 years old), and 11 who could not follow instructions (group C, median age: 1.6 years old). Preparation was used for patients in group B. The mean treatment times in groups A, B and C were 13.6, 17.1, and 15.6 min, respectively, on PBT treatment days 2-6, and 11.8, 13.0, and 16.9 min, respectively, for the last 5 days of PBT treatment. The time reduction was significant in group B (p = 0.003). Conclusion: Preparation is useful for pediatric patients who can communicate.

Participants completed the EAT and BITE questionnaires in the first phase. All participants who screened positive and 10% of the participants who screened negative were interviewed blindly using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR Axis I Disorders Patient Edition. ResultsThe BITE had better accuracy than the EAT in detecting ED in general among both dance and non-dance students. BITE scores of 19 and 16 were the optimal cutoff values for determining ED among dance and nondance students, respectively. The optimal cutoff value for the EAT to diagnose an ED was 19 for dance students and 12 for nondance students. Both questionnaires showed higher sensitivity and lower specificity in dance students than nondance students at the same cutoff points.

We explore contradictory ways in which these theories construct key factors that determine the successful development of human potential. Based on this comparison, we discuss the limitations of these theories stemming from their philosophical, methodological, and ideological backgrounds, including disproportionate emphasis on selected developmental factors, implicit one-way causality, and the dominant role of an individual over social influences. We further argue that the contradictory conclusions of these approaches may be reconciled within a systemic framework that acknowledges the reciprocal interactions between the key developmental factors proposed by these approaches, including learning outcomes, achievement motivation, practice and the social environment (including developmental resources and demands).

Moreover, most of these newly expressed genes were found to be turned on at a time coincidental with that of the 4-cell block of porcine embryos cultured in vitro. Our results demonstrate that DDRT-PCR is a feasible approach for rapid identification of genes that are differentially expressed in oviductal epithelium. Some of the genes thus identified may be important for unhindered development of embryos in the oviduct. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 56:331-335, 2000.

The study was conducted in Belgium, where, as in many countries, sperm donors receive recompense for their time and expenses. Face-to-face semi-structured interviews were conducted with 34 heterosexual and lesbian couples who, at the time of data collection, had at least one donor-conceived child aged 7-10 years or who were undergoing donor conception treatment. Although participants commonly described the issue of financial compensation as something that did not really concern them, all supported the idea that some level of payment was acceptable or even necessary. The participants also identified several ways in which donor payment offered advantages to their own position as (future) parents. Although the idea is commonly rehearsed that sperm donation is a gift and that monetary transaction for conception is demeaning, the participants of this study did not generally share this view. To them, a small financial return served as a symbolic acknowledgement of the donor's contribution and helped secure the type of relationship they expected from their donor. There was clearly concern, however, over high payments and the risk of attracting the wrong kind of donor. (C) 2015 Reproductive Healthcare Ltd. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Methods With a cross-sectional study design, we enrolled 278 school sports coaches as participants and adopted questionnaires to collect data. Self-reported data on demographics, job control, calling, work engagement, and job performance were collected from participants. We posted recruitment posters at the sports seminars/workshops for coaches and distributed an informed consent form and a questionnaire to coaches who were willing to participate in our study. Participants received an NT$100 gift voucher after they had filled out the questionnaire. Descriptive analyses (e.g., means, standard deviations, and correlations among focal variables, etc.), reliability and validity analysis, and a series of hierarchical regression analyses to test the hypotheses were adopted in this study. Results Job control is positively associated with job performance through work engagement. Further, the moderated mediation model demonstrated that job control has a stronger positive correlation with work engagement and job performance, especially when sports coaches possess higher levels of calling. Conclusion The current findings suggest that job control is a critical antecedent of job performance through work engagement and that a higher level of calling strengthens the relationship. We suggest that crafting an autonomy-supportive working environment will help empower sports coaches to set goals and become involved, which in turn supports sports coaches in achieving their goals and produces better individual/team performance.",2,2,Social Sciences - Other Topics; Psychology

The sensor was fabricated by simple casting of silver nanowires (Ag NWs) aqueous solution on a Pt electrode. Silver nanowires were synthesized by an L-cysteine-assisted poly (vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP)-mediated polyol route. UV-vis spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were employed to investigate the prepared nanowires. The electrochemical properties of H2O2 sensor were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronoamperometry. The as-obtained silver nanowires exhibited favorable electro-reduction activity toward H2O2, and results indicated that the Ag NWs modified Pt (Ag NWs/Pt) electrode might be gifted from CV scanning with higher surface area and more active sites that afford more effective surface exposure in the electrode-electrolyte interface and consequently improved electrochemical properties. At the applied potential of -0.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl, the Ag NWs/Pt electrode as an enzyme-free sensor exhibited a wide linear range of 0.5 mu M-30 mM to H2O2, with a remarkable sensitivity of 9.45 mu A/mM, a detection limit of 0.2 mu M estimated at a signal-to-noise ratio of 3 and fast response time (within 5 s). Moreover, it showed good reproducibility, anti-interferant ability and long-term stability. The excellent performance of the sensor might be attributed to the well-defined silver nanowires with special catalytic activity. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",43,43,Chemistry

AimsThis study aimed to understand the experiences of parents and the variety of parenting roles maintained during admission to a secure forensic hospital. MethodsNarrative interviews with 18 parents (eight mothers and 10 fathers) at an English medium security hospital were analysed thematically, using the framework approach. The proportion of patients who are parents and their contact patterns with their children were estimated from records. ResultsAbout a quarter of men and 38% of women were parents. Parenthood was of central importance to their emotional life, spanning experiences of loss, shame and failed expectations, joy, responsibility and hope. Fewer fathers maintained contact with their children than mothers yet fatherhood remained a vital aspect of men's identities, with impact on their self-esteem. Parenting during lengthy admissions - while constrained and dependent on professional support and surveillance - ranged from sending gifts and money to visits and phone calls. Offending was seen as a particularly shameful aspect of admission, contributing to distancing from the children and difficulty explaining detention to them. ConclusionsSuch complex experiences call for multidisciplinary knowledge and skills. Provision of focused therapy, as well as appropriate visiting spaces, creative approaches to contact time and support for patients in explaining their mental illness and detention to their children are recommended.

The few studies on iron status of male adolescent athletes found a low incidence of iron deficiency. The present study investigated the iron status of male and female gymnasts (G) and compared it with athletes of other sports. Subjects were 68 elite athletes (43 M, 25 F) ages 12-18, of four sports: gymnasts (11 M, 12 F), swimmers (11 M, 6 F), tennis players (10 M, 4 F), and table tennis players (11 M, 3 F). All lived in the national center for gifted athletes, trained over 25 hr a week, ate in the same dining room, and shared a similar lifestyle. Mean levels of hemoglobin (Hb), red blood cell indexes, serum ferritin, serum iron, and transferrin were measured in venous blood. There was no difference in mean Rb among gymnasts (G) and nongymnasts (NG). However, Hb was less than 14 g/dL in 45% of M G vs. only 25% in NG, and less than 13 g/dL in 25% of premenarcheal F G vs. 15% in NG. Low transferrin saturation (<20%) was detected in 18% of M G and 25% of FG vs. 6% and 8% in male and female NG, respectively (p < .05). The percentage of males suffering from low ferritin level (<20 ng/ml) was twice as high in G (36%) vs. NG (19%), and about 30% in all females. In summary, iron stores were consistently lower in M G vs. NG.

The tendency for obligate asexuality to evolve is thought to be reduced in animals whose males play a critical role beyond the contribution of gametes, for example, via care of offspring or provision of nuptial gifts. To our knowledge, the evolution of obligate asexuality in such species is unknown. In some species that undergo frequent inbreeding, males are hypothesized to play a key role in maintaining genetic heterozygosity through the possession of neo-sex chromosomes, although empirical evidence for this is lacking. Because inbreeding is a key feature of the life cycle of termites, we investigated the potential role of males in promoting heterozygosity within populations through karyotyping and genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism analyses of the drywood termite Glyptotermes nakajimai. We showed that males possess up to 15 out of 17 of their chromosomes as sex-linked (sex and neo-sex) chromosomes and that they maintain significantly higher levels of heterozygosity than do females. Furthermore, we showed that two obligately asexual lineages of this species-representing the only known allfemale termite populations-arose independently via intraspecific hybridization between sexual lineages with differing diploid chromosome numbers. Importantly, these asexual females have markedly higher heterozygosity than their conspecific males and appear to have replaced the sexual lineages in some populations. Our results indicate that asexuality has enabled females to supplant a key role of males.",3,3,Science & Technology - Other Topics

To counter female resistance that usually breaks off genital connection, male scorpionflies (Mecoptera: Panorpidae) usually provide nuptial gifts for the female and seize their mates with grasping devices. The notal organ, a modified clamp on tergum III of male scorpionflies, plays a significant role in seizing the female wings and helping maintain mating position during copulation. The mating behaviour remains unknown for the scorpionflies Furcatopanorpa longihy-povalva (Hua and Cal, 2009) whose male lacks a notal organ. In this paper, we first attempt to study the mating behaviour of F. longihypovalva. The results show that the male provides liquid salivary secretion through a mouth-to-mouth mode for the female, and maintains copulation mainly by continuous provision of salivary secretion rather than by seizing the female with grasping devices. Thus the male copulates with the female in an atypical O-shaped position, with only their mouthparts and genitalia connected to each other. The salivary glands exhibit remarkable sexual dimorphism: short and bifurcated in the female, but well-developed and multi-furcated in the male. The extremely developed salivary glands of the male lay a structural foundation for the male to continuously provide liquid salivary secretion, and to help the male to mediate female resistance, being likely to serve as a compensation to his absence of the notal organ. We also investigated the functional morphology and copulatory mechanism of the male and female genitalia. The evolution of the atypical mating pattern of F. longihypovalva is putatively discussed as an adaptation in the context of sexual conflict.",15,16,Zoology

Therefore, this study attempts to introduce four types of fuzzy synthetic decision methods in actual scores for evaluating and ranking student's academic achievement. Using the synthetic decision method of fuzzy theory, the four types of composite operations are used in conjunction with the membership function, and finally fuzzy means are used to express the diverse evaluation results of students. This study uses junior high school first year students in central Taiwan as research subjects, selecting the actual mid-term exam results of the gifted class and general class as research data. The fuzzy synthetic decision method is applied through four types of composite operations, proposing a ranking system that is more diverse and precise than the traditional average method. Finally, this study proposes the characteristics of the four types of fuzzy composite operations, considering the most suitable composite operations for classes with different characteristics. Results of this study can be used as a reference for educators in the field and future researchers.

Prior studies have shown that physical self-concept accounts for most of the variation in self-esteem, with academic and social self-concepts playing a much lesser role. As pressure toward perfection seems to be increasing in education, appearance, and social relationships (three aspects that relate to crucial developmental tasks of adolescence), the goal of the present field study was to examine whether former findings still hold true in the light of the changing societal context. A sample of 2,950 students from a broad range of German secondary schools (47% girls, age 10-19 years) responded to a recently validated German-language questionnaire assessing multiple self-concept facets (Weber and Freund, 2010). We examined which self-concept aspects predict self-esteem best and whether the pattern is comparable across genders and achievement levels using latent regression analyses. Results show that self-concept of appearance is still by far the strongest predictor (total sample: B = 0.77, SE = 0.02, p < 0.01) and that this is especially the case for girls and students from special educational schools. Other aspects play a much lesser role. The discussion explores why appearance is so neglected, compared to the more academic subjects, and what school can do to account for its vast importance for students' self-esteem.",23,23,Psychology

A previous study indicated that people could obtain mercury for ritualistic use from botanicas located in Brooklyn, Manhattan, and the Bronx. Working closely with local community partners, we concentrated our recruiting efforts through health clinics located in potentially affected neighborhoods. We developed posters to advertise the study, conducted active outreach through local partners, and, as compensation for participation in the study, we offered a food gift certificate redeemable at a local grocer. We collected 460 urine specimens and analyzed them for total mercury. Overall, geometric mean urine total mercury was 0.31 mu g mercury/l urine. One sample was 24 mu g mercury/l urine, which exceeded the (20 mu g mercury/l urine) NYSDOH Heavy Metal Registry reporting threshold for urine mercury exposure. Geometric mean urine mercury levels were uniformly low and did not differ by neighborhood or with any clinical significance by children's ethnicity. Few parents reported the presence of mercury at home, in a charm, or other item (e.g., skin-lightening creams and soaps), and we found no association between these potential sources of exposure and a child's urinary mercury levels. All pediatric mercury levels measured in this study were well below a level considered to be of medical concern. This study found neither self-reported nor measured evidence of significant mercury use or exposure among participating children.

In this paper we investigated whether such cues from a dog's owner affected performance of dogs during momentary distal pointing trials. Dogs were tested in four groups. In the 'Blindfolded Owner' group, the owners did not see the experimenter's pointing gestures because they wore opaque glasses. In the 'Passive Clever Hans' group, owners were told before the test that if their dogs performed without error, they would receive a gift and their dog would be recorded in the 'smartest dogs registry'. In the 'Active Clever Hans' group, owners were instructed to help their dogs to the correct side by pushing them gently in the correct direction. The fourth group served as a control and owners did not wear a blindfold or receive any specific information. We found no influence of cues from the owners in any of the experimental groups. In contrast to studies based on olfactory cues, this suggests that momentary pointing gestures from a human experimenter can be a reliable communicative cue for adult companion dogs, even when dog owners are present and provide additional voluntary or involuntary cues. We suggest that for short-term studies of visual communication, where individual dogs have little opportunity to learn their owners' cues in the experimental context, the presence of owners may not necessarily distort results.",23,23,Behavioral Sciences; Zoology

The aim of this study was to develop a new parental rating scale for identification of intellectually gifted preschoolers (4 to 6 years of age). This new scale, the Preschooler's Ability Rating Scale (PARS), consists of two parts - PARS-PRE, which follows the principle of precocity and inquires about the age at which giftedness-relevant behavior appeared for the first time; and PARS-CUR, which focuses on the current level of abilities. Participants and setting. In total, 263 Czech mothers and 90 children participated in the main study. Hypotheses. PARS will have a two-dimensional structure corresponding to its two parts. Both parts will significantly correlate with scores on the Woodcock-Johnson: International edition II (WJ IE II COG). Statistical analysis. 1. Item analysis; 2. Exploratory factor analysis; 3. Correlational analyses with WJ IE II COG; 4. ROC analysis to evaluate the specificity and sensitivity. Results. Factor analysis suggests a three-factor structure - two of the factors correspond to the scale's original parts, and the third factor reflects early reading and counting (4 items from the precocity part). The diagnostic accuracy of the first two factors is similarly low (r(PRE) =.33, r(CUR) =.25), but substantially higher for the early reading/counting factor (r(LIT) =.52). Additionally, parental ratings are, in general, based more on children's verbal abilities than their nonverbal abilities. Given the low criterial validity, the authors do not recommend utilizing the PARS scale in practical setting, however, the conclusions are useful for further development of similarly-minded scales.

In order to attract users' attention, they often take measures to promote themselves. The security vulnerabilities in social media platforms may provide convenience for their user promotion work. We call this type of vulnerability the user promotion security vulnerability (UPSV). UPSV may cause unfair competition and endanger the interests of legitimate users and the social media platforms. Therefore it has great research significance to find and fix this vulnerability. In this paper, we propose a UPSV which widely exists in the function of sending messages to strangers of in-app chatting of many social media platforms. We first analyzed this vulnerability in some apps, and then YY app (China's largest live streaming platform) was chosen as the research object to verify the actual effect of the vulnerability on illegitimate user promotion. We took the method of promoting a target YY streamer through sending promotional links to viewers, and to improve promotion effect, we used the method of user preference learning to select viewers for promotion. The experimental results show that among the promoted viewers, more than 44% entered the target streamers' channels to watch live streaming, more than 21% followed the target steamers, and more than 13% gave gifts to the target steamers.

In this article we extend this further by giving meaning to the locations, i.e., the red packets are only accessible at specific places. The virtual red packets' locations and monetary amounts can be dynamically updated by the cloud center to encourage clients to collect additional data that may benefit the FL process. Further, we propose a distributed behavioral decision engine based on multiarmed bandits (i.e., choose which red packet to go for) in response to the incentive mechanism enforced by the cloud. Considering the movement cost and conflicts with otherclients, K-anonymity and probabilistic selection are introduced in the distributed behavioral decision to recommend the optimal red packet choice for clients without revealing their privacy. The experimental results demonstrate that PractFL outperforms the baselines in terms of classification accuracy. We also find that PractFL can effectively alleviate the overfitting problem caused by class imbalance during the training.",0,0,Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications

Hirosaki University, as the only national university in this area, has been performing numerous practical experiments related to apple production. In 1981, we started an apple breeding program and have since registered three cultivars: 'Koukou', 'Kurenainoyume', and 'Hirodaimisaki'. The three main objectives of this breeding program were: (1) to produce yellow-skinned apples to reduce the grower's need to induce skin pigmentation, (2) to produce red-fleshed apples to improve consumer interest and health, and (3) to produce large apples to increase consumption as gifts. 'Koukou' and 'HFF (Hirosaki Univ. Fujisaki Farm) 63', which have yellow skin, can be produced without the need for skin pigmentation treatments such as fruit rotation and defoliation. Moreover, these cultivars contain a high sugar content, particularly sucrose, which is desired by present-day consumers. 'Kurenainoyume', 'HFF33', and 'HFF60' are red-fleshed cultivars, and, since they have no astringent taste, they can be eaten uncooked. These three cultivars are also suitable for the Asian market, because they bear fruit with fresh weights of over 350 g. 'Hirodaimisaki' and 'Maruyamafuji' are triploid, and can yield fruits of approximately 500 g. Furthermore, the sweet aroma is an attractive feature of these cultivars. At present, we are preparing a cultivation manual for growers, and we are also investigating the functional constituents of these new cultivars, such as polyphenols and anthocyanins.",6,9,Plant Sciences; Agriculture

Recent developments in multifunctional nanostructure design using the advanced concept of nanoarchitectonics utilize this simple process of assembly. Amphiphilic self-assemblies involving lipids or proteins mimic the structure of biological systems, thus highlighting the necessity of a fundamental physical understanding of amphiphilic self-assembly towards a realization of the complex mechanisms operating in nature. Herein, we describe self-assembled microstructures of biocompatible and biodegradable tetraglycerol lauryl ether (C(12)G(4)) nonionic surfactant in an aqueous solvent system. Temperature-composition analyses of equilibrium phases identified by using small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) provide strong evidence of various spontaneously self-assembled mesostructures, such as normal micelles (W-m), hexagonal liquid crystal (H-1), and reverse micelles (O-m). In contrast to conventional poly(oxyethylene) nonionic surfactants, C(12)G(4) did not exhibit the clouding phenomenon at higher temperatures (phase separation was not observed up to 100 degrees C), demonstrating the greater thermal stability of the self-assembled mesophases. Generalized indirect Fourier transformation (GIFT) evaluation of the SAXS data confirmed the formation of core-shell-type spherical micelles with a maximum dimension ca. 8.7 nm. The shape and size of the C(12)G(4) micelles remained apparently unchanged over a wide range of concentrations (up to 20%), but intermicellar interactions increased and could be described by the Percus-Yevick (PY) theory (after Carnahan and Starling), which provides a very accurate analytical expression for the osmotic pressure of a monodisperse hard sphere.",30,30,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Materials Science; Physics

This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a brief smoking cessation advice delivered by briefly-trained youth counselors at the enrolment of an incentive-based smoking cessation campaign. The study design was a cluster 2-arm randomized controlled trial of 831 Chinese adult smokers who were recruited in public areas to participate in the Hong Kong Quit to Win Contest 2010. The intervention group (n = 441) received a 5-min quitting advice from the youth counselors, who were mainly undergraduate nursing students, and a 12-page self-help smoking cessation booklet at the enrolment, while the control group (n = 390) only received the same booklet. Biochemically confirmed quitters at 6-month follow-up could join a lucky draw that offered HK$10,000 (US$1282) cash prize to three winners and HK$4000 gift vouchers to the other 10 winners. Primary outcome was self-reported smoking abstinence at 6-month follow-up. By intention-to-treat, the intervention group had a non-significantly higher self-reported (18.4 versus 13.8%, OR = 1.40, 95% CI 0.96-2.04, p = 0.08) and validated quit rate (9.1 versus 6.7%, OR = 1.40, 95% CI 0.84-2.33, p = 0.20) than the control group at 6-month follow-up. The analysis with multiple imputation for missing data also found similar results. We concluded that the brief on-site advice by trained youth counselors had a modest effect on smoking cessation, but the effect was not significant. Future studies with larger sample size and results from higher participation of the biochemical validation to confirm the effectiveness are warranted.",12,12,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"

The methods of analysis, comparison, concretization, generalization are used as the operation methods. With the help of action methods scientific theories, confirmed practically, are systematized, contradictions are distinguished and solved, hypotheses are made. General relations for the topic of leadership, capable of forecasting and suggesting the major trends in leadership development, are formed. A theory of charismatic leadership is the most suitable to the contemporary conditions of the society development. Leadership is a natural gift, which develops and improves for the whole life. The stages of a leader formation - infancy, childhood, pupilage, maturity. During all the stages a leader, performing communications, experiences the mirror effect, which has both the positive and negative characteristics. The depth of the potential formation depends mostly of a qualitative level of those mirrors, which the leader looks at during all the stages of his, or her formation. There is a two-factor model of the leader's efficiency offered in the article, suggesting a combination of two roles - a visionary and hierarch. We conclude that a contemporary leader is in a permanent choice of a basic growth point acting under the conditions of uncertainty, or a need to continuously correct her/his strategy and tactics.",0,0,Social Sciences - Other Topics

The effects of Ce doping on the structural and optical properties of ZnO nanorods were investigated in detail. The samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), photoluminescence (PL) and Raman-scattering spectroscopy measurements. The XRD results showed that Ce was doped into ZnO nanorods because of no diffraction peaks of Ce or cerium oxide in the pattern. The synthesis temperature of Ce-doped ZnO nanorods decreased from 900 to 500 degrees C compared to that of pure ZnO nanorods. Compared with pure ZnO, UV peaks shifted towards the blue color and the intensity of visible peaks decreased after Ce doping. The PL properties of Ce-doped ZnO nanorods depend on both the synthesis temperatures and the dopant. In Raman spectra of doped samples, some classical modes, such as A(1) and E-1 modes, disappear, and the E-2 modes blue shift. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Suppliers are likely to put more limited capacity into completing orders, thus ignoring the quality of products. This will easily lead to the occurrence of product quality events, and then affect the goodwill of enterprise products. The innovations of this paper are as follows: first, based on the above facts, a negative and dynamic correlation between the delivery level and the quality level is established, which has been involved in previous studies. Second, the joint decision model of timely delivery, product quality, and marketing is constructed. Thirdly, centralized decision-making is the best way of supply chain cooperation, and cost sharing contracts can coordinate the supply chain. This paper provides guidance for enterprise managers when making decisions on quality, marketing and delivery. It also provides the basis for enterprise managers to formulate effective cooperation models. We can draw some research implications: when consumers are less sensitive to timely delivery, enterprises should give some coupons and small gifts to consumers in exchange for the extension of delivery time and put their limited capacity into improving the product quality. When consumers are highly sensitive to timely delivery, they can outsource some orders to cost-effective and professional third-party enterprises, which not only improves the delivery rate but also improves the product quality.",1,1,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology

However, a strategy that takes into account not only one's partner's previous action but also one's own previous action-such as a win-stay lose-shift strategy or variants of reinforcement learning-has also been considered an advantageous strategy. This study investigated empirically how behavioral models can be used to explain the variances in cooperative behavior among people. To do this, we considered games involving either direct reciprocity (an iterated prisoner's dilemma) or generalized reciprocity (a gift-giving game). Multilevel models incorporating inter-individual behavioral differences were fitted to experimental data using Bayesian inference. The results indicate that for these two types of games, a model that considers both one's own and one's partner's previous actions fits the empirical data better than the other models. In the direct reciprocity game, mutual cooperation or defection-rather than relying solely on one's partner's previous actions-affected the increase or decrease, respectively, in subsequent cooperation. Whereas in the generalized reciprocity game, a weaker effect of mutual cooperation or defection on subsequent cooperation was observed.",2,2,Science & Technology - Other Topics

Studies show that immigrants, especially women, have an increased risk of non-communicable diseases compared to ethnic Swedes. Somali immigrant women have increased rates of overweight and obesity, low fitness levels and low levels of cardiorespiratory fitness compared to non-immigrant women. These findings suggest that Somali women are at increased risk of developing lifestyle-related diseases. Few studies explore determinants of physical activity among Somali women. The aim of this study was to explore Somali women's views and experiences of physical activity after migration to Sweden. Methods: A qualitative focused ethnographic approach was used in this study. Four focus groups were conducted with twenty-six Somali women ranging from 17 to 67 years of age. Focus group discussions were recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using qualitative content analysis. Results: The analysis resulted in four main themes and ten categories: Life in Somalia and Life in Sweden, Understanding and enhancing health and Facilitators and barriers to physical activity. Great differences were seen between living in Somalia and in Sweden but also similarities such as finding time to manage housework, the family and the health of the woman. The extended family is non-existent in Sweden, making life more difficult. Health was considered a gift from God but living a healthy life was perceived as the responsibility of the individual. Misconceptions about enhancing health occurred depending on the woman's previous life experience and traditions. There was an awareness of the importance of physical activity among the participants but lack of knowledge of how to enhance activity on an individual basis. Enhancing factors to an active lifestyle were identified as being a safe and comfortable environment. Conclusions: Some barriers, such as climate, lack of motivation and time are universal barriers to an active lifestyle, but some factors, such as tradition and religion, are distinctive for Somali women. Since traditional Somali life never involves leisure-time physical activity, one cannot expect to compensate for the low daily activity level with leisure-time activity the Swedish way. Immigrant Somali women are a heterogeneous group with individual needs depending on age, education and background. Tailored interventions with respect to Somali traditions are necessary to achieve an actual increase in physical activity among migrant women of Somalian origin.",23,23,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Obstetrics & Gynecology"

It was developed within the Creativity Greenhouse project, which piloted a mechanism to create research proposals and distribute funding at a distance. This involved facilitated phases of collaboration and competition over multiple days of computer-mediated work, where participants communicate and interact through a virtual world. During the iterative development process, the lack of time for socializing, the intense focus on virtual resources, and a lack of time spent away from the screen were reported as negative issues in feedback from participants. This article reports on the development of the Creativity Bento Box and how it helped to address these issues. By providing physical resources that contrasted with the properties of the virtual world, it supported people to socialize and take breaks from their primary activity, allowed them to include physical space and artifacts in their interactions, and provoked moves away from the otherwise intense focus on the computer. The article reflects on the roles of the Bento Box as a gift, in bridging between physical and virtual contexts, its higher suitability during the earlier phases of ideation and group development, and its perception by participants as something framed. Through this, we highlight the underexplored potential of using physical, offline resources as a means to solve difficulties in distanced social interactions.",0,0,Computer Science; Engineering

There are several high spectral resolution techniques that have been in use for several years like Estimation of Signal Parameters via Rotational Invariance Technique (ESPRIT), Prony methods, etc. but these techniques require prior knowledge of number of modes present in the signal. Model Order (MO) estimation techniques have to make a trade-off between accuracy and their speed i.e., computational burden. Therefore, there is always a requirement of a technique that is fast as well as accurate. Design/methodology/approach The proposed standard deviation (SD) method eliminates the requirement of energy validation test and analyses the distribution pattern, i.e. standard deviation of eigenvalues to identify the number of modes present in the signal. Signal is reconstructed using estimated modes and reconstruction error is obtained to show accuracy of the proposed estimation. Findings Six test synthetic signals as well as one practical signal have been taken for validating the proposed method. The paper shows that proposed methodology has a better accuracy compared to modified exact model order (MEMO) method in high noise environment and takes very less computation time compared to the exact model order (EMO) method. Practical implications The proposed method has been practically implemented for harmonic/interharmonic analysis at a sewage treatment plant at GIFT City, Gujarat, India. Apart from this the proposed method is modeled in python-based tool and is run into low-cost Raspberry Pi like hardware to create an onsite as well as remote monitoring device. Originality/value SD-based approach for model order estimation is novel to this area. Further, the proposed method is compared with EMO and MEMO under varying noise conditions to check for accuracy and estimation time.",0,0,Computer Science; Engineering; Mathematics

For this purpose, it is necessary to find out what a human being is and what connects people with each other; to describe the living conditions of society; to find out which circumstances initiate people's activity in society; to define what the purpose of public life is. The combination of hermeneutic, dialectic, and phenomenological methods allows to understand the place and role of a person who represents the uneducated class in the structure of the European society in the 17th-18th centuries. Peasants' views on the world in general, the society organization, their standards of living, socio-economic ideas found reflection in folklore. Studying European (German, French, Scandinavian, Russian) fairy tales collected by Charles Perrault, the brothers Grimm, Alexander Afanasyev, and works of Fernand Braudel and Robert Darnton allow to draw a conclusion that for ordinary people fairy tales served as means of communication, education, transmission of traditions and cultural schemes. Harmonious communication with nature is found when characters of fairy tales work on land and hunt. Their dearest wish is to get a magic object as a gift and not to need food any more, which reflects the agrarian orientation of economy, the natural reasons of deficiency of means for life. Images of silly, greedy, lazy rich men and of poor people who are forced to work to earn a living, not to get rich, indicate not only the understanding of the unfair social structure by an ordinary person, but also offer available means of maintenance of the socio-economic balance: cunning, wit, resourcefulness, and also theft, deception. Financial interest is a common condition for people's activity in European fairy tales. The image of a fool in Russian folklore discloses the non-economic value of human life in harmony with nature. Society ignores the contemplative activity of a person as it does not lead to a change of the surrounding space, but can call into question the bases of the social fabric in which financial interest acts as a condition of society's existence, and human activity is a condition of its functioning.",0,0,Social Sciences - Other Topics

Conceptualizations of grace seem predominantly constructed within theological and theoretical frameworks, whereas these conceptualizations may be poorly aligned with the definitions of grace of lay persons. This study clarifies the concept of grace and creates a bottom-up definition, based on the understanding of non-experts in a secularized society. A total of 456 Belgian adults (64% female, mean age = 50.04) provided descriptions of grace in an online survey. A multidisciplinary coding team conducted quantitative and qualitative content analysis (Nvivo). The following themes and categories emerged (1) virtuous qualities: grace is recognized in a multitude of good qualities with forgiveness as the ultimate example; (2) extra-ordinary gift: grace is something you receive unmerited, the nature of the giving goes beyond mere fair exchange; (3) transcendent and immanent setting: grace is encountered in the realm of the divine as well as in human relationships and daily life; (4) profound experience: the giving and receiving of grace entails an articulated personal involvement leading to new beginnings and freedom and (5) profound feelings: the experience of grace is accompanied with positive feelings and states often preceded by negative feelings and states. Distribution of categories by respondent's age, gender, and religiosity showed robustness of underlying characteristics in the definition of grace. However, significant group differences are found: believing and older participants described more often extra-ordinary and transcendent characteristics, whereas nonbelievers used more referrals to faults and forgiveness. Believing people used more positive feelings and women used more virtuous qualities in describing grace. The importance of further investigating the psychological dynamics of grace and its capacity for enhancing well-being is highlighted.",3,3,Psychology; Religion

Forty-six percent of households (n = 181) owned pets; 15% of all households (n = 60) owned cats and 33% (n = 130) owned dogs. Twenty-seven of these households (7%) owned both cats and dogs. Data were provided on 91 cats evenly divided between males and females. The median age was 3 years (range 0.2-10 years). Forty-one percent of cats (36/87) entered the household as strays. Nearly half lived entirely outside. Seventy percent (62/ 88) had visited a veterinarian at least once; 43% (39/91) were sterilized. About 1/3 had had a litter and all litters were considered accidental rather than planned. Age, indoor/outdoor status, veterinarian visit and region were all associated with sterilization. Age, confined to a yard, veterinary visit and region were associated with allowing the cat to roam freely. Data were provided on 182 dogs. Sixty-two percent (113/ 181) were male, with a median age of 4 years (range newborn to 17 years) and 40% (72/181) were purebred. Almost half were acquired as a gift. Sixty-two percent (112/180) were kept entirely outside despite the fact that 82% (147/180) were considered companions rather than working dogs. Almost all of the dogs had been to a veterinarian at least once; only 20% (n = 29) were sterilized. Male dogs were significantly less likely to be sterilized than females. Almost half the dogs had had at least one litter. Seventy-six percent (137/180) of dogs knew some basic commands. Sex, source and training to sit/stay/come were significantly associated with whether the dog was sterilized. Dog size, confinement to a yard, trained to leash walk, veterinary visit and region were predictors of roaming freely. Source and trained to leash walk were associated with dog registration.

We have investigated the structure (mainly shape and size) of the monomyristin reverse micelles depending on alkyl chain length of the oils, temperature, and the surfactant concentration. Moreover, we present how addition of trace-polar additives such as water or glycerol and the hydrophilic size of the surfactant affect the structure of the micelles. Monomyristin could not form any self-organized structure in nonpolar media at room temperature because of its smaller headgroup size and tends to separate from the nonpolar media. In dilute regions this surfactant forms a solid dispersion, which upon heating transforms into an isotropic reverse micellar solution. For the structural characterization of the reverse micelles formed at elevated temperatures, we have performed small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements, and the data were analyzed utilizing the generalized indirect Fourier transformation (GIFT) method. The SAXS data have shown that the size of the reverse micelles increases with the alkyl chain length of oils and surfactant concentration but decreases with temperature. A dramatic growth to the micelles could be achieved when the hydrophilic size of the surfactant is increased. Furthermore, addition of trace water or glycerol induces a significant change in the structure of micelles in terms of a cross-section and maximum length. The added water tends to form a water pool in the micellar core and results in swollen micelles. Model-free cross-section analysis of the SAXS data provided complementary information on the structural parameters. Thus, the present study has highlighted the possible ways of controlling the structure, mainly the shape and the size of the inverse micelles.",44,44,Chemistry

Therefore, it is important to improve our understanding of how young children manage to exert self-control. This study investigates two- and three-year-old children's behaviours during two self-control tasks and the association between the occurrence of these behaviours and task success. Furthermore, the study examines relations between timing and occurrence of these behaviours and caregiver-rated self-control. Two- and three-year-olds (N = 62) were given a snack and gift delay of gratification task to measure self-control. The following behaviours were coded second-by-second during the delay: direction of visual attention and the body (directed towards or away from the reward), distracting with the hands (fidgeting), and actively 'withholding' the hands (e.g., holding one hand with the other). To assess caregiver-rated self-control, parents and teachers filled out a selected set of items from the Early Childhood Behaviour Questionnaire inhibitory control scale (Putnam et al. 2006). The percentage of time that children looked away and withheld their hands from the reward positively predicted task success, suggesting that these behaviours are strategic at this young age. Average latency of initiating these behaviours was <10 s for successful children.

Using 4 113 local type 2 AGNs at 0.02 < z < 0.05 selected from Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7, we detected a broad component of the Ha line with a Full-Width at Half-Maximum (FWHM) ranging from 1 700 to 19 090 km s(-1) for 142 objects, based on the spectral decomposition and visual inspection. The fraction of the misclassified type 1 AGNs among type 2 AGN sample is similar to 3.5%, implying that a large number of missing type 1 AGN population may exist. The misclassified type 1 AGNs have relatively low luminosity with a mean broad H alpha luminosity, log L-H alpha, = 40.50 +/- 0.35 erg s(-1), while black hole mass of the sample is comparable to that of the local black hole population, with a mean black hole mass, log M-BH = 6.94 +/- 0.51 M-circle dot. The mean Eddington ratio of the sample is log L-bol/L-Edd = -2.00 +/- 0.40, indicating that black hole activity is relatively weak, hence, AGN continuum is too weak to change the host galaxy color. We find that the 0(III) lines show significant velocity offsets, presumably due to outflows in the narrow-line region, while the velocity offset of the narrow component of the H alpha line is not prominent, consistent with the ionized gas kinematics of general type 1 AGN population.",12,13,Astronomy & Astrophysics

It is accepted that sexual selection promotes the evolution of sex-specific elaborations. Due to the faster replenishment rate of gametes, males generally have higher potential reproductive and optimal mating rates than females. Therefore, sexual selection acts strongly on males [2], leading to the rapid evolution and diversification of male genitalia [3]. Male genitalia are sometimes used as devices for coercive holding of females as a result of sexual conflict over mating [4, 5]. In contrast, female genitalia are usually simple. Here we report the reversal of intromittent organs in the insect genus Neotrogla (Psocodea: Prionoglarididae) from Brazilian caves. Females have a highly elaborate, penis-like structure, the gynosome, while males lack an intromittent organ. The gynosome has species-specific elaborations, such as numerous spines that fit species-specific pouches in the simple male genital chamber. During prolonged copulation (similar to 40-70 hr), a large and potentially nutritious ejaculate is transferred from the male via the gynosome. The correlated genital evolution in Neotrogla is probably driven by reversed sexual selection with females competing for seminal gifts. Nothing similar is known among sex-role reversed animals.",37,40,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Cell Biology

Although a plethora of measurement instruments exists to assess executive function in children, only few of these are suitable for toddlers, and even fewer have undergone psychometric evaluation. The present study evaluates the psychometric properties and validity of an assessment battery for measuring EF in two-year-olds. A sample of 2437 children were administered the assessment battery at a mean age of 2;4 years (SD = 0;3 years) in a large-scale field study. Measures of both hot EF (snack and gift delay tasks) and cool EF (six boxes, memory for location, and visual search task) were included. Confirmatory Factor Analyses showed that a two-factor hot and cool EF model fitted the data better than a one-factor model. Measurement invariance was supported across groups differing in age, gender, socioeconomic status (SES), home language, and test setting. Criterion and convergent validity were evaluated by examining relationships between EF and age, gender, SES, home language, and parent and teacher reports of children's attention and inhibitory control. Predictive validity of the test battery was investigated by regressing children's pre-academic skills and behavioral problems at age three on the latent hot and cool EF factors at age 2 years. The test battery showed satisfactory psychometric quality and criterion, convergent, and predictive validity. Whereas cool EF predicted both pre-academic skills and behavior problems 1 year later, hot EF predicted behavior problems only. These results show that EF can be assessed with psychometrically sound instruments in children as young as 2 years, and that EF tasks can be reliably applied in large scale field research. The current instruments offer new opportunities for investigating EF in early childhood, and for evaluating interventions targeted at improving EF from a young age.",88,89,Psychology

A standardized questionnaire was used to investigate general practices and management of diabetes. Results: Eighteen of the THs were male, ages 22-70 years. Thirteen were trained through family members, while five never received training, citing that they were born with or received their gift in a dream. All THs treated physical illnesses, including diabetes. Plants were used by all THs and were usually dispensed in the form of powder. Nine THs stated that they could lower blood sugar levels, while five said they were able to cure diabetes completely. Many THs cited referring patients to biomedical treatment centers if unable to manage their conditions either initially or after treatments were unsuccessful.

It is not only the behavioural fountainhead for the society but also a binding force which determines and regulates the individual and collective behaviour. A peep into culture provides the glimpses of the individual and social behaviour of the people. It determines what desirable conduct or behaviour is of or the members of the society. It is expressed through the medium of language and art, philosophy and religion, education and science, films and newspapers, radio and T.V., social habits and customs, political institutions and economic institutions, industry and sports. The administrative culture of the any country is the product of the,peculiar social, cultural, economic and political milieu of which it is a part. Governance problems of India including corruption are deeply rooted in its cultural milieu. Institutions of public administration and its system and processes can be better understood if the cultural environment is understood properly. History of India is divided into 3 phases for the purpose of study: Ancient India: From earliest times to 1206 AD, Medieval India: From 1206 AD to 1757 AD and Modern India. In the ancient Indian literature available from the Indus Valley civilization (2500BC-1750BC) reveals that small kingdoms dominated the political scene and there is no mention of corruption during that era. In the medieval India, India was invaded by foreign rulers who settled here after capturing the throne. The mixed culture fostered a culture, of acceptance of the practices which might not have been termed as corruption during those days, but are considered as corruption in the modern world. In the modern India, during the rule of the East India Company and the British Raj, corruption was rampant. The situation in this era was so grim that Pitt's India Act of 1784 made acceptance of any gift by the company's servant a cognizable offense punishable with imprisonment. In the independent India corruption has become institutionalized there is scarcely any area of governance free from this malaise. What is alarming is the extent of the corruption both in its magnitude and it is apparent in all pervasiveness as also the highest levels of governance to what it has reached. It has become our supreme task to find the ways to strengthen the representative institutions and prevent democratic polity from sinking further into the muck of corruption. In the transparency international report on corruption of (2012) India is ranked at 94th position out of 176 nations. The supreme court of India in (March 2013) in a recent judgement stated that corruption has spread like an epidemic making people believe that unless bribe is given, the work may not be done. According to latest information 162 of 543 M.P.s of the current Parliament (2009-14) have been charge sheeted by courts of law. After defining the corruption the first part of the paper makes an attempt to present. a succinct review of corruption in India during ancient, medieval and modern times. As the corruption has been ubiquitous; so the author in the second part of this paper will enumerate major causes of corruption in India, followed by the implications and consequences of corruption for governance.

In this case an increased expression is found on several cases of preeclampsia. One of the efforts to prevent preeclampsia is by giving antioxidants such as Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) or it's better known as olive oil (Oleoa europaea), in the form of extra virgin known for its rich antioxidant content of tocopherols (vitamin E). The purpose of this study is to determine the expression levels of Hsp70 serum on pregnant white rat model of preeclampsia after being given EVOO. This type of research is true experiment; the subjects were female white rats and male virgin with Sprague Dawley, +/- 8-11 weeks old, 180g BB s /d 200g, healthy and didn't show any physical defects. Samples were 25 animals, divided into 5 groups, which consisted of different control and treatment given to T2 (rat model of preeclampsia), T3 (rat model of preeclampsia + EVOO 0.45g/bw/day), T4 (rat model of preeclampsia + EVOO 0.9g/bw/day) and T5 (rat model of preeclampsia + EVOO 1.8g/bw/day). The determination of each group was done by simple random sampling. Result on serum levels of Hsp70 that were tested by Elisa test in rats showed the average control was 14.64 mg /ml, group T2: 22: 51 mg/ml, T3: 13.62 mg/ml, T4: 15.92 mg/ml, T5: 16: 09 mg/ml. ANOVA test showed the P value was 0.001 < 0.005, which meant there were significant differences on serum Hsp70 levels in the control and treatment pregnant rats group. It was known that there was a significant difference level of Hsp70 serum in group of control rats with T2 (P value < 0.001) after LSD test was conducted, but not so with the group T3, T4, and T5, where the difference was not significant. There was a significant difference in the levels of Hsp70 serum on group T2 and T3 (P value <0.000), T4 (0004), T5 (0000). The gift of EVOO in the treatment group which was given EVOO with even low doses was able to control the induction of Hsp70 serum levels, which was not excessive, so the process of apoptosis did not occur excessively, especially in PE models. In this case, Hsp70 served as as an anti-apoptotic and it's is suggested to further research to observe the relationship of Hsp70 and apoptotic index.",2,2,Materials Science; Sport Sciences

It is important to understand factors that contribute to early self-regulation skills among children at risk for adjustment difficulties in these domains, such as children growing up in poverty. The current study examined mother-reported child temperament (negative affect, effortful control) and observed maternal parenting (during a mother-child free play) as contributing factors to toddlers' observed self-regulation during delay of gratification tasks at 27 months (snack delay) and 33 months (gift delay). Participants were 198 toddlers (M (age) = 27 months; 53% boys; 48% non-Hispanic white) and their mothers from low-income families. Mothers' negative parenting characterized by negative affect, hostility, and negative control was associated with poorer self-regulation contemporaneously. Toddlers' lower negative affect and higher effortful control predicted better self-regulation at 33 months, but positive parenting characterized by positive affect and sensitivity moderated these associations at both time points. Specifically, we found a buffering effect of high positive parenting among toddlers with a temperamental risk and a deleterious effect of low positive parenting despite toddlers' temperamental strength. Results highlight the importance of positive parenting for fostering the development of self-regulation among toddlers growing up with poverty-related and child-level risks.",9,9,Family Studies; Psychology; Psychiatry

Nigeria is one of only 4 countries among the 22 with an HIV testing rate for pregnant women of less than 20%. Currently, most pregnant women must access a healthcare facility (HF) to be screened and receive available prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission (PMTCT) interventions. Finding new approaches to increase HIV testing among pregnant women is necessary to realize the WHO/President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) goal of eliminating new pediatric infections by 2015. Methods: This cluster randomized trial tests the comparative effectiveness of a congregation-based Healthy Beginning Initiative (HBI) versus a clinic-based approach on the rates of HIV testing and PMTCT completion among a cohort of church attending pregnant women. Recruitment occurs at the level of the churches and participants (in that order), while randomization occurs only at the church level. The trial is unblinded, and the churches are informed of their randomization group. Eligible participants, pregnant women attending study churches, are recruited during prayer sessions. HBI is delivered by trained community health nurses and church-based health advisors and provides free, integrated on-site laboratory tests (HIV plus hemoglobin, malaria, hepatitis B, sickle cell gene, syphilis) during a church-organized 'baby shower.' The baby shower includes refreshments, gifts exchange, and an educational game show testing participants' knowledge of healthy pregnancy habits in addition to HIV acquisition modes, and effective PMTCT interventions. Baby receptions provide a contact point for follow-up after delivery. This approach was designed to reduce barriers to screening including knowledge, access, cost and stigma. The primary aim is to evaluate the effect of HBI on the HIV testing rate among pregnant women. The secondary aims are to evaluate the effect of HBI on the rate of HIV testing among male partners of pregnant women and the rate of PMTCT completion among HIV-infected pregnant women.

However, to date, quantitative research that has investigated the strategies online groomers employ to gain their victim's trust is scarce. Objective: To this end, the main aim of this study was to distinguish and measure different strategies of the online grooming process by developing and examining the psychometric properties of the Multidimensional Online Grooming Questionnaire (MOGQ). We also analyzed the prevalence of different strategies of online grooming among a sample of minors and their associations with grooming outcomes (i.e., online sexual solicitations and sexual interactions) and mental health (i.e., depression and anxiety). Participants and setting: The sample consisted of 1704 participants between 12 and 15 years of age (864 girls; Mage = 13.77, SD = 1.13). Methods: Examination of the structure of the MOGQ was accomplished using Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA). For this purpose, the sample was randomly divided into two subsamples. Results: EFA and CFA showed a structure composed of five factors, including Use of Deception, Gift giving, Study of victim's environment, Sexualization, and Aggression. Second, the analysis of the relationship of online grooming with grooming outcomes (online sexual solicitations and sexual interactions) and mental health (i.e., depression and anxiety) provided evidence for the concurrent validity of the instrument. Finally, the prevalence of grooming strategies within the sample ranged between 7% for aggression to 18% for interest in the victim's environment. Overall grooming strategies were more prevalent for girls than boys and increased with age. Conclusion: Distinguishing between different strategies of online grooming is recommended in order to advance research and the prevention of this type of child abuse.",2,2,Family Studies; Psychology; Social Work

Considering the growing need to identify alternative bio-nutritional sources, some underutilized species of figs (Ficus carica L., F. palmata Forssk., F. racemosa L.) and mulberries (Morus alba L., M. nigra L, M. laevigata Wall.) of the family Moraceae were evaluated as wild edible fruits to study their nutritive and mineral composition in order to prioritize their edibility for indigenous people. Materials and methods. The major proximal components (moisture, ash, lipids, proteins, fibers and carbohydrates) were determined by standard AOAC methods. The concentration of various minerals (K, Ca, Mg and Na) and trace elements (Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu and Ni) were recorded by using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Results. Our results indicated a range of moisture contents from 17.82-80.37 g center dot 100 g(-1) (fresh weight basis) in F. carica-M. laviegata; protein, 6.31-13.50 g center dot 100 g(-1) (dry weight basis) in F. glomerata-M. alba; crude fats, 1.02-2.71 g center dot 100 g(-1) in F. palmate-F. glomerata; carbohydrates 69.47-75.58 g center dot 100 g(-1) in M. alba-M. nigra; and fiber 7.63-17.81 g center dot 100 g(-1) in M. laviegata-F. palmate, respectively. The significantly highest energy value was computed in M. laviegata (367.7 kcal center dot 100 g(-1)). Moreover, sufficient quantities of essential elements were found in all the studied materials.

Besides the fittest strain under isolation conditions, many others coexist. Population dynamics with appropriate cell-to-cell interaction would provide such diversity: for example, secretion of beneficial metabolites from the fittest strain could feed others and enable the coexistence. But how this interaction is achieved and maintained remains elusive. Following a recent theoretical study suggesting that appropriate leakage of essential metabolites is beneficial to the leaking cells themselves, we demonstrate that mutualistic relationships among diverse species can be established as a result of cell-level adaptation of metabolite leakiness: each species cross-feeds others by secreting out essential metabolites for its own sake, which are usefully consumed by others, as if cells exchange gift chemicals with each other. In this case, exchange of metabolites is entangled, which leads to the coexistence of diverse microbes, and the resultant ecosystems are resilient against external perturbations including removal of each coexisting species. A new basis for diverse, complex microbial ecosystems is thus presented. Microbial communities display remarkable diversity, facilitated by the secretion of chemicals that can create new niches. However, it is unclear why cells often secrete even essential metabolites after evolution. Based on theoretical results indicating that cells can enhance their own growth rate by leaking even essential metabolites, we show that such leaker cells can establish an asymmetric form of mutualism with consumer cells that consume the leaked chemicals: the consumer cells benefit from the uptake of the secreted metabolites, while the leaker cells also benefit from such consumption, as it reduces the metabolite accumulation in the environment and thereby enables further secretion, resulting in frequency-dependent coexistence of multiple microbial species. As supported by extensive simulations, such symbiotic relationships generally evolve when each species has a complex reaction network and adapts its leakiness to optimize its own growth rate under crowded conditions and nutrient limitations. Accordingly, symbiotic ecosystems with diverse cell species that leak and exchange many metabolites with each other are shaped by cell-level adaptation of leakiness of metabolites. Moreover, the resultant ecosystems with entangled metabolite exchange are resilient against structural and environmental perturbations. Thus, we present a theory for the origin of resilient ecosystems with diverse microbes mediated by secretion and exchange of essential chemicals.",4,4,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Mathematical & Computational Biology

The present study examines gender differences in first injection experience among rural residents who predominantly inject prescription opioids. Methods: Interview-administered questionnaires collected data from a sample of injection drug users (n = 394) recruited from Appalachian Kentucky using respondent-driven sampling. Results: Women were more likely to have initiated injection due to social-pressure (p = 0.001), received the drugs as a gift (p = 0.011), initiated in their partner's home (p = 0.004) and in their partner's presence (p < 0.001), been injected by their partner (p < 0.001), used an unclean syringe (p = 0.026), and received the syringe from their partner (p < 0.001). Women were also more likely to report having engaged in sexual intercourse before or after initiation (p < 0.001). Men were more likely to have personally purchased the drugs (p = 0.002), to have acquired the syringe from a pharmacy/clinic (p = 0.004), and to have injected with a friend (p = 0.001) or family member (p = 0.020). Men were also more likely to have a friend administer the first injection (p = 0.007). Conclusions: In this population of rural drug users, notable gender differences in injection initiation were observed. Social pressure played a more substantial role in women's first injection experience, and male partners had an integral role in women's initiation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

However, the effectiveness of phenotype of labeled cells by SPIONs is still a matter of question. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficiency and biological effects of labeled mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) using ferumoxide- protamine sulfate complex. Materials and Methods: In an experimental study, undifferentiated mESCs, C571 line, a generous gift of Stem Cell Technology Company, were cultured on gelatin-coated flasks. The proliferation and viability of SPION-labeled cells were compared with control. ESCs and embryoid bodies (EBs) derived from differentiated hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) were analyzed for stage-specific cell surface markers using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Results: Our observations showed that SPIONs have no effect on the self-renewal ability of mESCs. Reverse microscopic observations and prussian blue staining revealed 100% of cells were labeled with iron particles. SPION-labeled mESCs did not significantly alter cell viability and proliferation activity. Furthermore, labeling did not alter expression of representative surface phenotypic markers such as stage-specific embryonic antigen 1 (SSEA1) and cluster of differentiation 117 (CD117) on undifferentiated ESC and CD34, CD38 on HSCs, as measured by flowcytometry. Conclusion: According to the results of the present study, SPIONs-labeling method as MRI agents in mESCs has no negative effects on growth, morphology, viability, proliferation and differentiation that can be monitored in vivo, noninvasively. Noninvasive cell tracking methods are considered as new perspectives in cell therapy for clinical use and as an easy method for evaluating the placement of stem cells after transplantation.",6,7,Cell Biology

Test of a costly signaling model of apology,EVOLUTION AND HUMAN BEHAVIOR,Apology; Costly signaling theory; Handicap principle; Sincerity,RELIGIOUS BEHAVIOR; CHEAP TALK; GENEROSITY; EVOLUTION; COOPERATION; INFORMATION; SELECTION; CONFLICT; HANDICAP; LIFE,"The present study examined a costly signaling model of human apology. The model assumes that an unintentional transgressor is more motivated to restore the relationship with the victim than an intentional transgressor who depreciates the relationship. The model predicts the existence of a separating equilibrium, in which only sincere apologizers will pay a certain cost to restore the relationship, while dishonest apologizers will not. Accordingly, we hypothesized that the receivers of an apology would be sensitive to the cost involved in the apology. Experiments I and 2 were vignette experiments, in which participants imagined that they were victims of an interpersonal transgression and received either a costly or no-cost apology. The costliness of the apology was manipulated by the presence of an apology gift in Experiment 1, and by inconvenience voluntarily experienced by the transgressor to make an apology in Experiment 2. In both experiments, participants found the costly apologizer to be more sincere than the no-cost apologizer. Experiment 3 employed a modified dictator game, in which a fictitious partner behaved in an unfair manner and apologized to the participants. The apology cost was manipulated as a fee for sending the apology message. The results of Experiments I and 2 were replicated. In addition, when given a chance to send a complaint message to the unfair person, participants in the costly apology condition abstained from doing so. Implications of the study are discussed in relation to applications of the costly signaling theory to interpersonal behavior. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Students' academic performance can be influenced by various context and personal factors of the students. In the first case, for example, by the educational practice of their family of origin, and by the parental support with homework and learning at home. In the second case, for example, by the characteristics of the students, as well as by their intellectual aptitudes. The aim of this study was to obtain an explicative model of relationships between context variables (students ' perception of family support, and parents ' self-evaluation of support provided to their children), students ' intellectual aptitudes, parents' educational level, and academic achievement in reading comprehension at the end of elementary school. Method. The participants were 362 sixth graders from rural, indigenous and public schools in Sonora and Morelos, Mexico. The study was conducted during the academic course of 2015. Parents' support in learning their children at home was evaluated by mean of versions of the Family Support Perception Questionnaire (FSPQ), one for the parents and the other for students. The FSPQ evaluated four dimensions of support parents: 1. Homework Help /Reviewing, 2. Communication with school/Participation, 3. Conditions and Resources for studie in home, and 4. Monitoring/Communication with teachers. For assess the academic performance about Reading Comprehension was used an instrument attached to the curriculum for the sixth-grade of elementary school, with 17 items evaluating five dimensions: 1. Identifying spelling errors in five short texts, 2. Inferring implicit information and understand metaphors from narrative texts and short story, 3. Recognizing literary figures in poetry, 4. Inferring the meaning of words in the dominant indigenous language, and 5. Identifying sections of a newspaper. Intellectual aptitudes were measured using reduced versions of two scales of the Screening Assessment for Gifted Elementary and Middle School Students (SAGES-2), validated in Mexican context: 1. Thirteen items of the Language, Literature and Social Studies scale and 17 items for the General Reasoning scale. Results. The results of a structural regression model with the EQS 6.4 program, showed that reading performance was explained mainly and significantly by the students ' intellectual aptitudes, and secondly, by parent's support (evaluated by themselves). However, family support perceived by the students had no significant effects on reading performance. On the other hand, the parents ' academic level showed a significant direct effect on students' intellectual abilities, and had as well an indirect effect on students' academic performance in reading comprehension. Discussion and Conclusion. The results show that the intellectual aptitude of the students is presented as a better predictor of their performance in reading comprehension than the variables of family support. One possible reason is that the Language Arts/Social Science subscale of SAGES-2 is probably highly associated with curricular content and learnings related to reading comprehension. However, it is important to highlight the effect of two variables in the family context. First, selfperceived parental support had a positive effect, although less so, on student performance. The second aspect is that the parents' level of schooling had a significant effect on the intellectual skills assessed here.",0,0,Psychology

The latter most clearly shows the problems of greening the modern economic activity and the traditional Northern economy associated with the use of the gifts of nature. The paper highlights methodological principles of economic evaluation of wildlife and the analysis of Northern (domestic and foreign) experience of their taxation; we propose a scheme for transition from the disparate approaches to the taxation of this activity (resource, permission, compensation, etc.) to an integrated environmental-economic approach. In addition to the existing norms, this approach includes imposing excise duties on the production of weapons, ammunition and equipment; establishing a targeted environmental fee on the use of subsoil; imposing fines for unlimited or excessive withdrawal of wildlife objects; establishing funds for the protection of wild animals and birds in the system of local budgets. A new approach harmonizes the interests of the state (RF subjects and local government bodies), local population of the Northern territories, nature users (including hunters), subsoil users, and manufacturers of weapons and equipment. We determine the source of formation of tax revenues of local budgets; this measure makes it possible to finance environmental protection measures, reproduction of wild animals and birds, creation of infrastructure in remote Northern territories. The paper proves the necessity of introducing innovative methods for state monitoring of wildlife and correct distribution of functions of federal, regional and local authorities in its reproduction.",0,0,Business & Economics

Therefore, this study aimed at the description of resilience, perceived social support and trait anxiety levels of mothers of children with stuttering, as well as at the exploration of the relationship between them. Methods: The study sample consisted of 33 mothers of children with stuttering aged 6-12 years. The data were gathered using the following instruments: Mother Resilience Scale, Revised Parental Social Support Scale, State-trait Anxiety Inventory, Stuttering Severity Instrument-4, and a personal information form. Results: Resilience of mothers of children who stutter was high, whereas perceived social support and trait anxiety levels of the participants were lower. Mother's increased level of perceived social support resulted in increased resilience level and decreased trait anxiety level. The trait anxiety levels of mothers with a college degree were significantly lower than those of mothers with other education levels. No statistically significant correlation was observed between stuttering severity and the levels of resilience, perceived social support and trait anxiety. Conclusion: Although mothers of stuttering children present the required skills to cope with the situation, it is believed that they need more social support. Consequently, offering professional support to mothers in the course of stuttering management and referring them to appropriate intervention programs are emphasized.",1,2,Audiology & Speech-Language Pathology

The relation between birthdays and the subsequent risk of an off-road vehicle crash is unknown. Methods We conducted a population-based before-and-after longitudinal analysis of youth who received emergency medical care in Ontario, Canada, due to an off-road vehicle crash between April 1, 2002, and March 31, 2014. We identified youth injured in an off-road vehicle crash through population-based health-care databases of individuals treated for medical emergencies. We included youth aged 19 years or younger, distinguishing juniors (age <= 15 years) from juveniles (age >= 16 years). Results A total 32,777 youths accounted for 35,202 emergencies due to off-road vehicle crashes within six months of their nearest birthday. Comparing the six months following a birthday to the six months prior to a birthday, crashes increased by about 2.7 events per 1000 juniors (18.3 vs 21.0, p < 0.0001). The difference equaled a 15% increase in relative risk (95% confidence interval 12 to 18). The increase extended for months following a birthday, was not observed for traffic crashes due to on-road vehicles, and was partially explained by a lack of helmet wearing. As expected, off-road crash risks did not change significantly following a birthday among juveniles (19.2 vs 19.8, p = 0.61). Conclusions Off-road vehicle crashes leading to emergency medical care increase following a birthday in youth below age 16 years.

The dilute mixtures of C(12)G(1) with the aforementioned oils are essentially a solid dispersion at lower temperatures without forming any liquid crystalline phases, which are transformed into isotropic reverse micellar solutions upon heating. The generalized indirect Fourier transformation (GIFT) analysis of the SAXS data has drawn a clear picture of the structural variations of the reverse micellar aggregates in the isotropic solution phase. A notable effect on the micellar growth emerges when cyclohexane is replaced with the linear-chain hydrocarbon oils; a gradual increase of the carbon number of the hydrocarbon skeleton from octane to hexadecane, ellipsoidal prolate-like micelles are eventually transformed to long rod-like ones. Far more pronounced structural enhancement could be achieved by increasing the hydrophilicity of the surfactant, as short-rod micelles observed in the C(12)G(1)/decane system are replaced with long cylindrical ones when a more hydrophilic diglycerol monolaurate (C(12)G(2)) is used. This fact also supports a scenario that regulates the ability to form elongated to reverse structures. Lowering the temperature and increasing the surfactant concentration similarly lead to micellar growth while the cross-sectional structure remains essentially unchanged. In contrast, polar additive-induced growth is accompanied by the rapid swelling of the micellar core. Our data demonstrate that optimization of the oil properties and/or other outer conditions provide possible routes to flexibly controlling the size, shape, and internal structure of the reverse micelles despite lower universality for a shorter hydrophilic chain surfactant.",27,27,Chemistry; Physics

Secondary objectives were to determine whether contingency management was associated with changes in heavy drinking, treatment attendance, drug use, cigarette smoking, psychiatric symptoms, and HIV-risk behavior. Method: Seventy-nine (37% female, 44% nonwhite) outpatients with serious mental illness and alcohol dependence receiving treatment as usual completed a 4-week observation period and were randomly assigned to 12 weeks of contingency management for EtG-negative urine samples and addiction treatment attendance, or reinforcement only for study participation. Contingency management included the variable magnitude of reinforcement prize draw procedure contingent on EtG-negative samples (<150 ng/mL) three times a week and weekly gift cards for outpatient treatment attendance.

Results: Contingency management participants were 3.1 times(95% CI=2.2-4.5) more likely to submitan EtG-negative urine test during the 12-week intervention period, attaining nearly 1.5 weeks of additional alcohol abstinence compared with controls. Contingency management participants had significantly lower mean EtG levels, reported less drinking and fewer heavy drinking episodes, and were more likely to submit stimulant-negative urine and smoking-negative breath samples, compared with controls.

Protocols are needed to prudently increase physical activity in asthma patients. We evaluated whether an educational intervention enhanced with positive-affect induction and self-affirmation was more effective than the educational protocol alone in increasing physical activity in asthma patients. Methods: We conducted a randomized trial in New York City from September 28, 2004, through July 5, 2007; of 258 asthma patients, 252 completed the trial. At enrollment, control subjects completed a survey measuring energy expenditure, made a contract to increase physical activity, received a pedometer and an asthma workbook, and then underwent bimonthly follow-up telephone calls. Intervention patients received this protocol plus small gifts and instructions in fostering positive affect and self-affirmation. The main outcome was the within-patient change in energy expenditure in kilocalories per week from enrollment to 12 months with an intent-to-treat analysis. Results: Mean (SD) energy expenditure at enrollment was 1767 (1686) kcal/wk among controls and 1860 (1633) kcal/wk among intervention patients (P=.65) and increased by 415 (95% CI, 76-754; P=.02) and 398 (95% CI, 145-652; P=.002) kcal/wk, respectively, with no difference between groups (P=.94). For both groups, energy expenditure was sustained through 12 months. No adverse events were attributed to the trial. In multivariate analysis, increased energy expenditure was associated with less social support, decreased depressive symptoms, more follow-up calls, use of the pedometer, fulfillment of the contract, and the intervention among patients who required urgent asthma care (all P<.10, 2-sided test).

The mechanistic studies reveal that prevention of Tau aggregation by cobalt-based metal complexes (CBMCs) is concentration-dependent and Tau seldom exhibits conformational changes. Interestingly, CBMCs play dual role in causing disassembly of preformed aggregates as well as inhibition of complete Tau aggregation. Furthermore, CBMCs were nontoxic and maintained the tubulin network intact. CBMCs also prevented okadaic acid-induced toxicity in SH-SY5Y cells thus, preventing hyperphosphorylation of Tau.

The present study sought to explore decision making regarding which parent would donate a kidney to their child among Muslim Arab parents of pediatric ESRD patients. Design and methods: The study design is a cross sectional qualitative study. We conducted semi-structured interviews with thirty-one parents: twenty-five mothers and six fathers, who donated a kidney to their child. Results: Parents tended to refrain from donating a kidney to a sick daughter; mothers were more willing to donate than fathers. Our findings imply that culturally constructed notions of gender and motherhood are mobilized to the realm of health and illness, and mothers' body work is an influential factor in determining survival chances of pediatric ESRD patients and their quality of life. Conclusions: Our study shows that kidney donation made by mothers to their children represents a gendered body work and powerfully demonstrate gender relations in Arab society. Cultural artefacts shape parents' differential propensity to donate organs for a female or a male offspring. Practice implications: It is recommended that the nursing staff enlist the help of Muslim clerics to increase the willingness of fathers to donate a kidney for their offspring, and also to encourage both parents to donate a kidney to a sick daughter. Education campaigns are needed to raise awareness and encourage changes in the attitudes of the Muslim families of pediatric ESRD patients toward parental kidney donation. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Myostatin (MSTN) has been proved to be a negative regulator of skeletal muscle growth. Mutation of MSTN gene resulted in significant increase in both body size and muscle mass in vertebrates, mostly with a species-specific effect. To generate a new strain in Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) with fast growth traits, the molecular characterization, gene expression and functional studies of mstn gene were extensively investigated. Phylogenetic and synteny analyses indicated that mstnb, but not mstna, might be the orthologous gene of mammalian MSTN gene. Expression pattern analyzed by qRT-PCR demonstrated that mstnb is abundant in muscle, while mstna is dominantly expressed in the brain. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis also demonstrated that mstnb is exclusively expressed in the basement membrane of white skeletal muscle fibers, further suggesting the possible role of mstnb gene in tilapia muscle growth. To verify the roles of mstnb in skeletal muscle growth, we obtain the mstnb(-/-) mutant using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology. Compared with the wild type (WT) fish, the mstnb(-/-) mutants showed a typical double-muscle phenotype with increased muscle mass, sticking out between head and dorsal fin, from 5 months after hatching (mah). Morphological observation revealed an excessive proliferation of white muscle fibers at 7 mah. The average body weights (21.67 +/- 8.26 g), body heights (4.46 +/- 0.65 cm) and body widths (2.36 +/- 0.53 cm) of the mstnb(-/-) fish were 49.45%, 32.74% and 37.21% higher than those of the mstnb(+/+) fish (body weight, 14.50 +/- 8.60 g; body height, 3.36 +/- 0.45 cm; body width, 1.72 +/- 0.18 cm) at 5 mah. The results showed that the growth performance parameters of the mstnb(-/-) fish, including weight gain rate (1.99 times), condition factor (1.77 times) and specific growth rate (1.23 times), were significantly higher than the mstnb(+/+) fish under laboratory conditions at 5 mah. In addition, the parameters of WGR, CF, SGR and FE were significantly increased in mstnb(-/-) Nile tilapia than those of mstnb(+/+) Nile tilapia and GIFT tilapia for a 90-day feeding trial under the wild natural environment. Interestingly, sexually dimorphic effects on muscle growth have been found with an increase of growth performance of skeletal muscle in mstn(-/-) XY fish, but not mstn(-/-) XX fish at 7 mah.

Leprince de Beaumont; Beauty and the Beast; folktale type AT 425 C,,"The study of Khioniya Demidova's translation of the fairy tale Beauty and the Beast (Saratov, Shlyapkin Collection, No. 456) gives an idea of the Russian-French lexicon of the mid-18th century, of the practice of teaching foreign languages in Russian noble families in the mid-18th century, and complements our notions of relations in the Demidov family. The translation of the tale was made by young Demidova in 1758, two years after the publication of Leprince de Beaumont's Magasin des enfants (Vols 1-4, Londres, 1756). The French-language textbook by Leprince de Beaumont Magasin des enfants contained instructive conversations, initial information on geography, history, extracts from the Holy Scripture and moralizing tales; among the latter was a fairy tale about a beauty and a beast, whose fame surpassed its direct source, the novel Histoire de la Belle et de la Bete (1740) by Gabrielle-Suzanne Barbot de Villeneuve. Apparently, Demidova received this book among other new books that her older brothers sent regularly from their educational tour of Europe in 1750-1761. The brothers could learn the news about the publication of the original textbook intended for the upbringing and education of noble young ladies in their Russian foreign circle. During the trip, the Demidovs regularly communicated with representatives of the Russian aristocracy and diplomats close to the court, including A.M. Golitsyn, M. Posse, A.S. Stroganov, K.E. Sivers. All these persons were among the Russian subscribers of the London edition of Leprince de Beaumont. The hand-written book created by Demidova looks like a gift and is dedicated to her brother, Pyotr Grigorievich Demidov. Demidova's translation as a whole accurately follows the original, including syntactic calques. Errors in declension and unstable spelling suggest that Khioniya was learning the Russian written language simultaneously with French, and that her Russian writing was phonetic rather than conventional, reinforced by the knowledge of the Russian grammar. A striking feature of the translation is the use of colloquial expressions and a regular use of Russian realities. This gave the fairy tale traits of Russianness, which is especially noticeable against the background of the neutral stylistics of the printed translation (by Pyotr Svistunov) of Magasin des enfants published in 1761. Some researchers mistakenly believe that Demidova's handwritten translation was distributed in the form of numerous manuscripts. On the contrary, it must be admitted that it was the printed edition that was distributed in a handwritten form. Nevertheless, Khioniya Demidova's translation deserves attention as the first translation into Russian of the popular fairy tale Beauty and the Beast in the Russian style (S.T. Aksakov's version continued this direction). Povest' o Labelle i zvere [A Tale of Beauty and the Beast] (Saratov University Library, No. 456) is published for the first time.",1,1,Linguistics

It has great therapeutic and nutritional importance. Emblica officinalis, also known as Indian gooseberry or Amla, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family. Amla is beneficial for treating illnesses in all its forms. The most crucial component is a fruit, which is also the most common. It is used frequently in Indian medicine as a restorative, diuretic, liver tonic, refrigerant, stomachic, laxative, antipyretic, hair tonic, ulcer preventive, and for the common cold and fever. Hyperlipidemia is also known as high cholesterol or an increase in one or more lipid-containing blood proteins. Various phytocompounds, including polyphenols, vitamins, amino acids, fixed oils, and flavonoids, are present in the various parts of E. officinalis. E. officinalis has been linked to a variety of pharmacological effects in earlier studies, including hepatoprotective, immunomodulatory, antimicrobial, radioprotective, and hyperlipidemic effects. The amla-derived active ingredients and food products nevertheless encounter challenges such as instability and interactions with other food matrices. Considering the issue from this perspective, food component nanoencapsulation is a young and cutting-edge field for controlled and targeted delivery with a range of preventative activities. The nanoformulation of E. officinalis facilitates the release of active components or food ingredients, increased bioaccessibility, enhanced therapeutic activities, and digestion in the human body. Accordingly, the current review provides a summary of the phytoconstituents of E. officinalis, pharmacological actions detailing the plant E. officinalis's traditional uses, and especially hyperlipidemic activity. Correspondingly, the article describes the uses of nanotechnology in amla therapeutics and functional ingredients.",1,1,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Engineering

We conducted a qualitative study to explore risk situations that can explain the high HIV prevalence among youth in Kisumu town, Kenya Methods: We conducted in-depth interviews with 150 adolescents aged 15 to 20, held 4 focus group discussions, and made 48 observations at places where youth spend their free time. Results: Porn video shows and local brew dens were identified as popular events where unprotected multipartner, concurrent, coerced and transactional sex occurs between adolescents. Video halls - rooms with a TV and VCR often show pornography at night for a very small fee, and minors are allowed. Forced sex, gang rape and multiple concurrent relationships characterised the sexual encounters of youth, frequently facilitated by the abuse of alcohol, which is available for minors at low cost in local brew dens. For many sexually active girls, their vulnerability to STI/HIV infection is enhanced due to financial inequality, gender-related power difference and cultural norms. The desire for love and sexual pleasure also contributed to their multiple concurrent partnerships. A substantial number of girls and young women engaged in transactional sex, often with much older working partners. These partners had a stronger socio-economic position than young women, enabling them to use money/gifts as leverage for sex. Condom use was irregular during all types of sexual encounters. Conclusions: In Kisumu, local brew dens and porn video halls facilitate risky sexual encounters between youth. These places should be regulated and monitored by the government. Our study strongly points to female vulnerabilities and the role of men in perpetuating the local epidemic. Young men should be targeted in prevention activities, to change their attitudes related to power and control in relationships. Girls should be empowered how to negotiate safe sex, and their poverty should be addressed through income-generating activities.",33,33,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"

There are two sorts of donors in the blood donation system voluntary and replacement donors. Objectives In this study, we examined Saudi adults' knowledge, beliefs, and associated factors towards blood donation in Saudi Arabia. Methods A cross-sectional web-based survey was conducted over three months between November 2019 & January 2020 among the general public, using structured self-administered 18-items online questionnaires. A descriptive analysis was performed, a chi-square test was conducted to determine the relationships between the variables. A p-value Results A total of 364 respondents (93.1%) believed that blood donation is an important responsibility of every individual. When asked about the reason for previous donations 261(66.8%) said voluntary while approximately 130 (33.2%) donated for their families and friends. Fear of needles 91 (23.3%), fear of infection 53 (13.6%) a lack of time 88 (22.5%) were common barriers, and 270 (69.1%) agreed that token gifts should be given to donors. In this study, 71.1% (n = 278) were found to have good knowledge, and 96.7% (n = 378) found positive beliefs towards blood donation. The knowledge is significantly associated with being a male gender (p < 0.049), and the educational level of the participants (p < 0.003). positive beliefs were significantly associated with young donors (p < 0.045) Conclusion These outcomes indicate that the Saudi public has positive beliefs and acceptable knowledge about blood donation and its importance in the society and health care system. Furthermore, educational programs should be done to increase the level of awareness about blood donation and its significance.",6,6,Hematology

Taking the benefit of isogeometric methods, the design density values for the mesh are defined using spline basis functions as a continuous density function (CDF) through the control points. The material density at the control points will then appear as a facade over the domain, which is further employed to generate a very smooth topology and also to propose a marking criterion for an adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) strategy during the optimization process. During this adaptive meshing, the isogeometric domain mesh is refined during each adaptive step, properly tracking the density variation over the elements and sharpening the boundaries of the optimized topologies. By utilizing the rationale of the Geometry Independent Field approximaTion (GIFT) framework, any complex multi-patch geometry constructed in an industry-standard CAD package using Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS) may be imported and discretized using PHT-Splines, including higher dimensions. This helps to maintain the geometrical accuracy through an initial coarse mesh and computational accuracy of the optimization iterations through the local refinement feature of the PHT-Splines. An adaptive first-neighbourhood smoothening algorithm based on the Shepard function is also proposed to obtain manufacturable topologies and to circumvent post-processing stages. The proposed method was observed to provide remarkably smooth topologies with an initial coarse mesh, thereby obtaining a computationally efficient domain to be solved. Compared to existing element density based methods, the proposed method demonstrates a substantial minimization in Degree's-of-Freedom (DoF) requirement to arrive at clear and realistic solutions. Also, when compared to globally refined solutions, a 50%-90% reduction in DoF is achieved using the adaptive refinement strategy.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

Participation in a contest is usually preceded by many years of practice requiring a high level of motivation and a supportive environment, especially regarding family. Despite the importance participation in music contests may have for musical development, there is a considerable research deficit. The annual music contest Jugend musiziert (youth making music) is the most important musical competition for highly gifted young musicians in Germany. There has been comprehensive research on the participants of Jugend musiziert by Hans Gunther Bastian in the 1980s and 1990s, but since then, only very little research has been published. In 2017, we started a large-scale study on the participants at the national level, covering a broad range of topics, including sociocultural background, development and learning, performance practice, personality traits, motivation, and musical performance anxiety. A standardized paper-pencil questionnaire was administered to approximately 2,260 participants and a total of 1,143 valid questionnaires was returned (age 9-24 years; M = 15; SD = 2.1, female = 62%). Using principal component, variance, correlation, and linear discriminant analyses, interdependencies between practice time and motivational factors were analyzed in this paper. Concerning practice time, major differences between participants of different contest categories became clear, with classical musicians practicing the most. Practice time, as well as parental support and supervision, correlated with age: Older participants spent, on average, more hours practicing and received less support and supervision. Challenge was the most important incentive for all participants, but more decisive for participants in the classical solo contest than in the ensemble category. Female participants were more prone to fear incentives than males. Participants who practiced a lot scored higher on general flow than the participants with a smaller amount of practice and also showed significantly more perseverance. Moreover, participants of the pop solo contest experienced more general flow than all other participants; ensemble players showed more social focus than participants in the classical solo contest. All in all, participants of different contest categories could be discerned by practice time and prototypical motivational aspects.",3,3,Psychology

Hybrid technologies involving nanomaterials can offer possible solutions to this research involving natural biopolymers. Porous chitosan with a high specific surface area has promising properties but its use as a membrane component in water purification is still rarely reported. Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is a carbon nitride allotrope with a graphene-like layered structure that gifts unfamiliar physicochemical properties due to the presence of s-triazine fragments. It is a metal-free semiconductor with a band gap of-2.7 eV to-3.7 eV; which shows better visible light-activated photocatalyst properties. This work aims at synthesizing graphitic carbon nitride-biopolymer composite and exploring its properties in the field of wastewater treatment. The samples were synthesized via a soft chemical process with urea, as the source material. The flake-like morphology is displayed in the microstructural SEM image. The composition of the material was analyzed using EDS. Thermogram shows that the material is stable up to 500 degrees C and also confirms the formation of graphitic carbon nitride. In XRD spectra the intensity reduction shows the chitosan inclusion at the nitride site. The band gap of the prepared material was identified to be 2.3, 2.4 eV. The structural properties were analyzed using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer and Raman spectroscopy. FTIR spectra and Raman spectra indicate the stretching vibration modes of C--N and C-N het-erocycles and chitosan inclusion in the carbon nitride network. The photocatalytic activity was done in sunlight and a UV lamp with different dyes for doped and undoped g-C3N4. The doped (Porous/Non-porous chitosan) g-C3N4 showed faster dye degradation in sunlight compared to UV light. A biomolecular interaction study was done using Bovine serum albumin. It shows the material interaction with the BSA protein. The anti-microbial activity was performed on the Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli by disk diffusion method, the chitosan doped g-C3N4 showed good inhibitions against bacterial growth. The current work reveals the impact of nanoscale chitosan nanostructures doped on the optical, microstructural, catalytic, and antimicrobial properties of g-C3N4 nanosheets. This work provides new research options for nanocomposite-based photocatalytic nanomaterial g-C3N4 so that the quality of contaminated water could be improved.",0,0,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Chemistry; Polymer Science
1807,2017,"Hoshikawa, K; Staudigl, M",A Schutzian Analysis of Prayer with Perspectives from Linguistic Philosophy,HUMAN STUDIES,Schutz; Wittgenstein; Prayer; Christianity; Speech act; Language-game; Multiple realities,,"In this paper, we propose to analyze the phenomenon of Christian prayer by way of combining two different analytical frameworks. We start by applying Schutz's theories of intersubjectivity, inner time, politheticality, and multiple realities, and then proceed by drawing on the ideas and insights of linguistic philosophers, notably, Wittgenstein's language-game, Austin's speech act, and Evans's logic of self-involvement. In conjoining these accounts, we wish to demonstrate how their combination sheds new light on understanding the phenomenon of prayer. Prayer is a complex phenomenon that involves two major dimensions: the private and the social, as Matthew (6: 6) and Acts (1: 14), respectively, demonstrate. Schutz's study of the phenomenon of inner time and the polithetical structure of consciousness, at both the subjective and intersubjective level, provides a useful lens to analyze these two dimensions. In addition, prayer, in following a specific set of rules, can also be considered as a specific, i.e., religious language-game. In the last analysis, however, we propose to analyze prayer (and, finally, religion) within the Schutzian framework of multiple realities, enclaves, and symbolic appresentation, which permits accessing the religious finite province of meaning in the very midst of the paramount reality of everyday life. In a nutshell, we claim that Christian prayer is a practice of constructing and living within a religious province of meaning in the everyday world; it is a practice that revolves around self-involving language-activities such as praising, confessing, thanksgiving, or requesting to God, which enable the praying subject to transfigure the language of everydayness and see through (Schutz) the world of everyday life in order to let it appear in a different light, e.g., the light of grace, gift, and salvation.",2,2,Social Sciences - Other Topics; Sociology

Therefore, it has been essential to study the quality of life, especially in vulnerable populations, including children and adolescents. In this work, the psychological well-being, distribution of tasks and routines, as well as the physical activity done by children and adolescents from two samples: community and high abilities, have been analyzed. The methodology used was Mixed Method Research, through a survey conducted online through social networks. The informants were the parents of the children and adolescents, 209 in the community sample and 116 in the high ability sample. The instrument used was a questionnaire implemented through Google Forms, with open and closed questions, including the Kidscreen-27 scale to measure well-being. The assessment of the adequacy of the physical activity levels was analyzed through ALCESTE. The results showed the absence of differences between students from community samples and those with high capacities in well-being and physical activity. Parents residing in Spain observed less play time in the high ability sample, and more time spent on homework, whether or not they have a diagnosis of high ability. It is concluded that these results question the misconceptions held about high ability students in terms of poorer personal adjustment and better interest in physical activities.",7,7,Psychology

Methods: Post-reversed juvenile Nile tilapia (O. niloticus) of the GIFT (Genetic Improvement of Farmed Tilapia) strain were used in this study. The performance, ectoparasite prevalence and parasite load in the branchiae and skin as well as the liver and branchial histology. Fish were randomly assigned to receive one of four treatments: control, 20 mL hydroalcoholic solution (alcohol 30 degrees GL); 20 mL Homeopatila 100 (R) per kg of meal; 40 mL Homeopatila 100 (R) per kg of meal; or 60 mL of Homeopatila 100 (R) per kg of meal, compared to control with out the addition of the complex. There were four replications per treatment type (16 experimental units total) at a density of 40 fish per m(3) over a period of 57 days. The Kruskal-Wallis H test (p < 0.05) was employed to analyse the physical and chemical parameters of water as well as for parasite prevalence; whereas analysis of variance was used for liver performance. If the values were significant (p < 0.05), they were compared by Tukey's test. Multiple comparisons of averages were performed using Student's t test (p < 0.05). Results: There were no significant between the physical and chemical parameters of the water between the different groups at the end of the experiment. Significant differences (p < 0.05) in the mixed parasite conditions were found within the different Homeopatila 100 (R) treatments. The hepatosomatic ratio of fish treated with Homeopatila 100 (R) was significantly lower than that of fish from the control group. The best results in the liver and branchiae occurred in fish receiving Homeopatila 100 (R) at 40 mL/kg in terms of the number of hepatocytes/mm(2), the intercellular glycogenic behaviour, the rates of histological changes (hyperplasia, lamella fusion and telangiectasia) and the percentage of neutral and acidic mucin-producing cells.

The scattering data were evaluated by indirect Fourier transformation (IFT) or generalized indirect Fourier transformation (GIFT) methods depending on the volume fractions of the surfactants and also by model fit. A simple route to the growth control of reverse micelles by headgroup size of the surfactant was investigated. Additionally, the dependence of reverse micellar structure (shape and size) on temperature, composition, and added water was also investigated. The indirect Fourier transformation gives the real space pair-distance distribution function. p(r): a facile way for the quantitative estimation of structure parameters of the aggregates. It was found that the size of the reverse micelles increases with increasing the headgroup size of the surfactant. Globular type or micelles with maximum diameter ca. 6 nm observed in the monoglycerol oleic acid ester/decane system at 25 degrees C transferred into elongated prolate type micelles with maximum diameter ca. 19.5 nm in the hexaglycerol oleic acid ester/decane system. In a particular surfactant and oil system, increasing temperature decreased the micellar size. The size of the micelle was decreased by similar to 25% upon increasing temperature from 25 to 75 degrees C in the 5 wt % diglycerol oleic acid ester/decane system. Concentration could not modulate the structure of micelles despite a wide variation in the surfactant concentration (5-25 wt %). Nevertheless, increasing surfactant concentration reduces the intermicellar distance, and a strong repulsive interaction peak was observed in the scattering curves at higher surfactant concentrations. Besides, the results obtained from the dynamic light scattering have shown the signature of diffusion hindrance relative to hard sphere with the surfactant concentration. Interestingly, the reverse micelles of the 10 wt % diglycerol oleic acid ester/decane system could incorporate 1.2% water in the micellar core and cause a dramatic growth to the micelles size.

Both donors and non-donors have a positive image of blood donation, so donors and non-donors do not differ regarding their views on donation but do differ in converting their opinion into an active deed of donation. Several studies have identified altruism and empathy as the main factors underlying blood donation. However, a mixture of various motivational factors mould the complex behaviour of donation. This paper presents an exploratory study on differences of social representations of blood donation between blood donors and non-donors, in order to understand the reasons that bring someone to take the decision to become a blood donor. Materials and methods. Participants filled in the Adapted Self-Report Altruism Scale, Toronto Empathy Questionnaire and answered a test of verbal association. Descriptive and correlation analyses were carried out on quantitative data, while a prototypic analysis was used for qualitative data. Results. The study was carried out on a convenience sample of 786 individuals, 583 donors (mean age: 35.40 years, SD: 13.01 years; 39.3% female) and 203 non-donors (mean age: 35.10 years, SD: 13.30 years; 67.5% female). Social representations of donors seem to be more complex and articulated than those of non-donors. The terms that appear to be central were more specific in donors (life, needle, blood, help, altruism were the words most associated by non-donors; life, aid, altruism, solidarity, health, love, gift, generosity, voluntary, control, needed, useful, needle were the words most associated by donors). Furthermore, non-donors associated a larger number of terms referring to negative aspects of blood donation. Discussion. Aspects related to training and the accuracy of any information on blood donation seem to be important in the decision to become a donor and stabilise the behaviour of donation over time, thus ensuring the highest levels of quality and safety in blood establishments.",14,14,Hematology

Methods: A 20-item cross-sectional survey was mailed to a random sample of 1000 family medicine physicians practicing in North Carolina. Two weeks after the initial mailing, a reminder was sent to physicians. Physicians were entered into a drawing to receive a gift card as an incentive for survey completion. The questionnaire collected demographic information, factors important to physicians for collaboration with a community pharmacist, and physician perceptions of pharmacist qualifications. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze patterns in the Likert scale survey responses. Results: Of the 1000 mailed surveys, 67 were returned as undeliverable, resulting in a final sample size of 933 surveys. One hundred forty-six family medicine physicians responded to the survey, yielding a 15.6% response rate. Respondents were 58% male, 73% had been practicing longer than 10 years, and 60% had an academic affiliation. Our results indicate that an established relationship with a community pharmacist is the most important factor when considering a collaborative practice agreement. At least 90% of physicians reported that the most important pharmacist contributions were drug therapy adverse effect management, drug interaction management, medication access assistance, prescription counseling, and medication adherence. A majority of physicians reported that community pharmacists improve quality outcomes and metrics (74% and 72%, respectively). Conclusion: Physicians in North Carolina recognize the value of the services a pharmacist can provide to their patients. Developing relationships between community pharmacists and physicians and describing the value of additional credentialing in the provision of patient care will be integral in establishing collaborative practice agreements in the community setting.

TW were more likely to have sex while using alcohol (aPR 1.15, 95% CI: 1.01 to 1.31) or drugs (aPR 2.24, 95% CI: 1.47 to 3.41), have alcohol dependency (aPR 1.38, 95% CI: 1.15 to 1.66), engage in receptive anal sex (aPR 1.31, 95% CI: 1.26 to 1.36), and have received money, gifts, or favors in exchange of anal sex (1.96, 95% CI: 1.74 to 2.20). Conclusions: TW and MSM exhibited distinct risk profiles, suggesting that interventions specifically targeted to each group may provide new opportunities for more effective HIV prevention programs.",7,7,Immunology; Infectious Diseases

The article aims to compare two texts concerning byzantine diplomatic practices of the mid 10th century. The first one is described in the 13th chapter of the treatise De Administrando Imperio, in which its author Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus gave some pieces of advice to his son Romanus II Porphyrogenitus how to line up rhetorical manipulation during the negotiations with ambassadors of different `barbarian' nations. The second one is the description of conversation, which took place on September 17, 968 between emperor Otto I the Great's ambassador bishop Liudprand of Cremona and patrician Christopher. It is described in Liudprand's Relatio de Legatione Constantinopolitana. Methods. The classical comparative method is used to examine the veracity of two independent texts of different character describing the similar diplomatic trick. The author compares a program-ideological and simultaneously a propaedeutic treatises with a semiofficial report of a foreign senior ambassador. Analysis. In the 13th chapter of the treatise De Administrando Imperio its author Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus advised his son Roman II in negotiations with the ambassadors of the barbarian nations not to except the precedent of giving in marriage the granddaughter of the Byzantine emperor Romanus I Lecapenus Maria-Irina to Bulgarian ruler Peter, since Romanus I Lecapenus was a man of poor education and incompetent in the ancient sacred customs of the Roman Empire. In Relatio de Legatione Constantinopolitana by bishop Liudprand of Cremona during the confiscation of purple clothes, which he had bought, he referred to the fact that during his last visit to Constantinople, emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus had allowed him to take out even more expensive clothes without any obstacles. Contrary to this example, he received a reply from patrician Christopher, that emperor Constantine was a weak man and cherished the friendship of barbarians and foreigners with gifts, and ruling emperor Nikephoros II Phokas was a strong and warlike man, he didn't allow such liberties for foreigners. In both cases, the same counter-argument was used to disavow precedent - a criticism of the bygone emperor in comparison with the current sovereign. This suggests that it was a common rhetorical device for Byzantine diplomats. These two cases allow to clarify the sophisticated ideology of Tradition and its Split as a corner-stone political idea of Eastern Roman Empire. Results. As a result of comparing the texts De Administrando Imperio (952-959) and Relatio de Legatione Constantinopolitano (969) it becomes clear that Byzantine politicians in the mid 10th century used for disavowing diplomatic precedents the criticism of their own emperor, who agreed to some concessions in the past. His personality was declared inappropriate to the high standards of a Roman ruler in comparison with the current emperor. Such rhetoric was surprising for the peoples who considered a series of their rulers as a genealogical aggregate of relatives responsible for their predecessors as for themselves. Byzantine politicians calmly recognized imperfections of their bygone emperors, what allowed them to ignore the strongest diplomatic argument of the early Middle Ages - a historical precedent.",1,1,History

The sudden upsurge in digital electronic devices usage, namely personal computers, laptops, tablets and smartphones is unprecedented, which leads to a new wave of both mental and physical health problems among students, for example eye-related illnesses. The overexposure to electronic devices, extended screen time usage and lack of outdoor sunlight have put a consequential strain on the student's ophthalmic health because of their young age and a relative lack of responsibility on their own health. Failure to take appropriate external measures to mitigate the negative effects of this process could lead to common ophthalmic illnesses such as myopia or more serious conditions. To remedy this situation, we propose a software solution that is able to track and capture images of its users' eyes to detect symptoms of eye illnesses while simultaneously giving them warnings and even offering treatments. To meet the requirements of a small and light model that is operable on low-end devices without information loss, we optimized the original MobileNetV2 model with depth-wise separable convolutions by altering the parameters in the last layers with an aim to minimize the resizing of the input image and obtained a new model which we call EyeNet. Combined with applying the knowledge distillation technique and ResNet-18 as a teacher model to train the student model, we have successfully increased the accuracy of the EyeNet model up to 87.16% and support the development of a model compatible with embedded systems with limited computing power, accessible to all students.",0,0,Automation & Control Systems; Computer Science

This study aimed to examine (1) whether the inclusion of gamification features in a physical activity smartphone app was associated with improved app usage and goal adherence, describe (2) use of the gamification features, and (3) by whom, and determine (4) whether engagement was associated with increased physical activity.Methods: Data from community-dwelling adult participants (mean age 42.1 years, standard deviation [SD 11.9], 74% female) in the gamified (n = 134) and nongamified (n = 155) conditions from a three-group randomized controlled trial were analyzed. Physical activity was assessed at baseline and 9 months using a survey and accelerometers. App usage (number of days steps were logged), goal adherence (number of days step count was >= 10,000), and behavioral engagement with gamification features were obtained from server logs. Multilevel modeling was used to examine the study aims.Results: Participants who received the gamified app showed more days of usage than those who received the nongamified app (M = 113 days [SD 88] vs. M = 81 days [SD 54], P = 0.006), whereas goal adherence did not differ between groups. The leaderboard and status gamification features were the most frequently used gamification features (M = 83 [SD 114] and M = 50 [SD 67] views, respectively). Older age (P = 0.008) and lower body mass index (P = 0.004) were associated with more status views. Participants who reported higher stress symptoms sent more gifts (P = 0.04). The use of gamification features was associated with increased physical activity (P = 0.04).Conclusion: The gamified app was used substantially longer than the nongamified app. Use of gamification features was positively associated with change in physical activity.

We conducted 16 semi-structured interviews with actual or prospective oocyte donors. All of them were patients of two fertility clinics located in the city of Yekaterinburg (Russia) planning to become oocyte donors within the period from 2 weeks to 3 months. We built a profile of a Russian oocyte donor: it is a 26-year-old married woman with at least one child, she has a secondary vocational education and a low income. All the women in our study displayed multiple motivations: apart from the interest in a financial reward and purely altruistic motivations, for many women the decisive factor is their desire to help their friends or relatives struggling with infertility. Interestingly, almost all of our respondents described their decision to donate as an attempt to move past a traumatic situation they once endured and to achieve closure by doing something really important and good. For many women, oocyte donation becomes a way to boost their self-esteem, to feel more significant and to promote their personal autonomy. As for barriers to donation, one of the most important is associated with the donors' unwillingness to make their identity known and to share this information even with their close circle of friends and relatives. For the majority of donors, anonymity is crucial. The disclosure of this information, in their view, will cause controversy in the donor's family and immediate circle of friends at present and will threaten their privacy in the future. The prospective donors are also concerned about the negative public attitudes or lack of understanding.",0,0,Sociology

Sixty-minute individual interviews with scientists were used to assess the main factors involved in personal career choices. The investigation was based on a framework composed of personal ability, home environment, school environment, and sociocultural environment. The personal ability included personal interest, aptitude, and achievement; the home environment included parents, brothers and sisters, relatives, and hobbies; the school environment included teachers, friends, and club activities; the socio-cultural environment included public events, mass media, social recognition, and social prospects. Thirty scientists that had received science awards in Korea during 1990-2001 were sampled. Nineteen scientists (63.3%) stated that they had a specific dream before entering high school, yet only 5 scientists (17%) dreamed of becoming a scientist. Twenty-one scientists (70%) said that they decided on their future career in 12th grade or as a freshman at university, which is related to the Korean educational system. However, this decision time is relatively late. The results were analyzed based on the interview transcripts. According to the career choice procedures, personal ability, home environment, school environment, and socio-cultural environment were found to be almost equally important. In particular, personal interest and scientific aptitude, paternal influence, teachers (especially science teachers and professors), and social prospects were all emphasized. The younger scientists were more influenced by their personal aptitude and social prospects, while chemists and engineers were more influenced by their parents and social prospects.

The Medi-Cal Incentives to Quit Smoking project (2012-2015) promoted modest financial and medication incentives to encourage Medi-Cal smokers to utilize the California Smokers' Helpline (Helpline). This article describes the implementation and impact of two different direct-to-member mailing approaches. Methods: Medi-Cal Incentives to Quit Smoking promotional materials were mailed directly to members using two approaches: (1) household mailings: households identified through centralized membership divisions and (2) individually targeted mailings: smokers identified by medical codes from Medi-Cal managed care plans. Mailings included messaging on incentives, such as gift cards or nicotine patches. Number of calls per month, calls per unit mailed, and associated printing costs per call were compared during and 1 month after mailings. Activated caller response was based on reporting a household mailing promotional code or based on requesting financial incentives for individually targeted mailings. Analyses were conducted in 2018. Results: Direct-to-member mailings, particularly with incentive messaging, demonstrated an increase in call volumes during and 1 month after mailing, and increased Medi-Cal calls to the Helpline per unit mailed. Mailings with only counseling messages had the lowest percentage of activated calls per unit mailed, whereas the incentive messaging mailings were consistently higher. Although household mailings demonstrated lower printing costs per call, individually targeted mailings had a higher percentage of activated calls per unit mailed. Conclusions: Household and individually targeted mailings are feasible approaches to increase Medi-Cal calls to the Helpline, particularly with incentive messaging. Choosing an approach and messaging depends on available resources, timing, and purpose. (C) 2018 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.

Few studies have queried VFR travellers directly on barriers to seeking pre-travel care. We aim to describe the knowledge, attitudes and practices of VFRs travelling to malaria-endemic countries from the USA. With these findings, we aim to design interventions to encourage preventive behaviours before and during travel. Methods Sixteen focus groups were held in two US metropolitan areas with West African immigrant populations: Minneapolis-St. Paul, MN, and New York City, NY. A total of 172 people from 13 African countries participated. Focus group discussions were audio-recorded and transcribed, and modified grounded theory analysis was performed. Participants reviewed themes to verify intent of statements. Results Participants described the high cost of provider visits and chemoprophylaxis, challenges in advocating for themselves in healthcare settings and concerns about offending or inconveniencing hosts as barriers to malaria prevention. Cultural barriers to accessing pre-travel care included competing priorities when trip planning, such as purchasing gifts for family, travel logistics and safety concerns. When participants sought pre-travel care, most consulted their primary care provider. Participants expressed low confidence in US providers' knowledge and training about malaria and other tropical diseases. Conclusion Barriers to pre-travel care for VFR travellers are multifaceted and extend beyond their perception of disease risk. Only some barriers previously reported in anecdotal and qualitative literature were supported in our findings. Future interventions should be aimed at barriers identified by individual communities and involve primary and travel specialist healthcare providers. Additional work is needed to address systems-level barriers to accessing care and establishing community-based programs to support West African VFR traveller health.",15,15,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Infectious Diseases; General & Internal Medicine"

However, in the group opinions, the differences in the effects of authoritative and non-authoritative group opinions on the evaluation results have not been investigated. In this paper, we focused on the effect of the authoritative group opinions on product evaluation when there is a conflict between the personal opinion and group opinion. In the experimental design, the task of each participant was to choose one of two women's handbags as a birthday gift for their female colleagues on a nine-point scale. The brain activities of seven male volunteers were measured by using functional magnetic resonance imaging. By the results of the questionnaire after the experiment, we can determine that the authoritative opinions were from the female group and non-authoritative opinions were from the male group. Firstly, participants made the choices by themselves. And then, an average opinion from a male or female group was informed. Furthermore, the opinion has a positive or negative condition for the initial evaluation result of the participant. Finally, the same evaluation task was performed once again just as earlier. In order to investigate the effects differences in group opinions generated by authority and non-authority, we compared each participant's subsequent and initial evaluation results, and the brain activities at presenting the female and male group's opinions in positive and negative condition, respectively. Previous research suggested that frontal pole cortex (FPC) plays a role in evaluating self-generated decisions. As a result, in left FPC, we found the different brain activity patterns between the authoritative group opinions and the non-authoritative group opinions in the negative condition with one participant's data. In the future, we need to verify the results by collecting more data from new participants.",0,0,Computer Science

The small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) technique has been used for the structural characterization of micelles. It has been found that the nonionic surfactant glycerol monoisostearate (abbreviated as iso-C(18)G(1)) forms reverse micelles in different organic solvents such as cyclohexane, n-decane, and n-hexadecane without the addition of water. The structure (shape and size) of the reverse micelles has been found to depend on the solvent nature (alkyl chain length of oil), composition, temperature, and added water. Phase behavior study has shown that iso-C(18)G(1) forms isotropic single-phase solutions in the aforementioned oils at 25 degrees C. At lower temperatures (< 20 degrees C) 11 phases (dispersion of solid or liquid crystal phase) has been observed. SAXS data were evaluated by the generalized indirect Fourier transformation (GIFT) method, which has drawn a clear picture on the structural variations of the reverse micellar aggregates. Small globular types of micelles are found in the iso-C(18)G(1)/cyclohexane system. On the other hand, elongated ellipsoidal prolatelike or rodlike micelles are found in iso-C(18)G(1)/decane or iso-C(18)G(1)/hexadecane systems. The underlying mechanism of this structural evolution may be explained in terms of the transfer free energy of hydrophilic glycerol moiety from hydrophilic to hydrophobic environment of oils with different chain lengths. Besides, the penetration of oils to the lipophilic chain of the surfactant in reverse micellar systems differs depending on the chain length of oils. Lowering temperature and increasing surfactant concentration similarly lead to micellar growth while the cross-section structure remains essentially unchanged. Addition of trace water induced micellar growth, which is accompanied by the rapid swelling of the micellar core. The results obtained by this study demonstrate that the solvent nature, temperature, composition, and water addition can be the tunable parameters for the size, shape, and internal structure control of the iso-C(18)G(1)-based reverse micelles.",40,40,Chemistry; Materials Science

Conversely, there are few studies showing the long-term impact of low birth weight on productive performance of female piglets selected for the breeding herd. The aim of this study was toevaluate the effects of birth weight on reproductive performance and longevity up to the third farrowing of Landrace x Large White crossbred gilts. For most variables, 835 gilts selected for breeding were included in the analyses. When the analysis concerned the number of days in the herd from birth onwards, data from 1495 females were analyzed. Gilts were retrospectively classified into eight classes of birth weight (BiW), with approximately 12.5% of gilts in each group. Overall, gifts were 196.8 +/- 0.6 days old at first estrus manifestation, which occurred in 23.8%, 44.4% and 64.6% of gas within 10, 20 and 30 days of boar exposure, respectively, with no difference (P> 0.05) among BiW classes. Age at puberty was similar among BiW classes in gilts that showed estrus within 30 d of boar exposure (P >= 0.428), but PG600-gilts weighing 410-1160 g reached the puberty later than those weighing > 1400 g (P < 0.05). Removal due to anestrous was higher (P <= 0.093) in female piglets of 410-990 g (22.9%) compared with the other BiW classes (overall 9.6%). There were no differences among BiW classes in the first (P=0.480) and second (P=0.400) farrowing rate but piglets of 1000-1160 g and 1510-1610 g had lower third farrowing rate (P=0.041) than piglets weighing > 1620 g. The total number of piglets born (P=0.08) and piglets born alive (P= 0.028) were lower for the lightest BiW class in the first farrowing but they were similar among BiW classes in the second and third farrowing. The percentage of first-mated gilts that reached the third farrowing (68.7%) was not affected by BiW (P> 0.05). The third farrowing was reached at 627 +/- 1.17 days of age on average, with no significant difference among BiW classes (P=0.806). Females born weighing less than 1 kg produced about 45 fewer piglets along three.parities than the other BON classes (P <= 0.05). Female piglets weighing between 1.0 and 1.28 kg at birth were also negatively affected in terms of lifetime herd days, although to a less extent than those weighing less than 1 kg, in comparison with piglets weighing > 1.28 kg. However, the number of herd days, from selection for entry into the breeding herd to the third farrowing or removal, was not different (P=0.257) among BiW classes. The results of this study show that low BiW (< 1 kg) negatively influences the production of piglets and longevity of female swine. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",27,27,Agriculture

Nineteen boys between 4 and 7 years of age with ASD were compared to 28 TD boys while listening to musical stimuli of different aesthetic levels. The results from two musical experiments using the above participants, are described here. In the first study, responses to a Mozart minuet and a dissonant altered version of the same Mozart minuet were compared. In this first study, the results indicated that both ASD and TD males preferred listening to the original consonant version of the minuet over the altered dissonant version. With the same participants, the second experiment included musical stimuli from four renowned composers: Mozart and Bach's musical works, both considered consonant in their harmonic structure, were compared with music from Schoenberg and Albinoni, two composers who wrote musical works considered exceedingly harmonically dissonant. In the second study, when the stimuli included consonant or dissonant musical stimuli from different composers, the children with ASD showed greater preference for the aesthetic quality of the highly dissonant music compared to the TD children. While children in both of the groups listened to the consonant stimuli of Mozart and Bach music for the same amount of time, the children with ASD listened to the dissonant music of Schoenberg and Albinoni longer than the TD children. As preferring dissonant music is more aesthetically demanding perceptually, these results suggest that ASD male children demonstrate an enhanced capability of aesthetic judgment of music. Subsidiary data collected after the completion of the experiment revealed that absolute pitch ability was prevalent only in the children with ASD, some of whom also possessed extraordinary musical memory. The implications of these results are discussed with reference to the broader notion of neurodiversity, a term coined to capture potentially gifted qualities in individuals diagnosed with ASD.",10,11,Psychology

This phenomenon, which is not observed for any other price but zero, has been termed the zero-price effect (ZPE). The ZPE is attributed to an af-fective heuristic where the positive affect elicited by the free status of an item provides a mental shortcut biasing choice towards that item. Given that the ZPE relies on affective processing, a key role of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) has been proposed, yet neuroscientific studies of the ZPE remain scarce. This study aimed to explore the role of the vmPFC in the ZPE using a novel, within-subject assessment in participants with either an acquired (lesion patients) or degenerative (behavioural-variant frontotemporal de-mentia patients) lesion of the vmPFC, and age-matched healthy controls. All participants were asked to make a series of choices between pairs of items that varied in price. One choice trial involved an equal decrease of both item prices, such that one of the items was priced zero. In contrast to controls, patients with both vmPFC-lesion and behavioural -variant frontotemporal dementia showed marked reductions in zero-related changes of preference in pairs of gift-cards, but not for pairs of food items. Our findings suggest that affective evaluations driving the ZPE are altered in patients with focal or degenerative damage to the vmPFC. This supports the notion of a key role of the vmPFC in the ZPE and, more generally, the importance of this region in value-based affective decision-making. Our findings also highlight the potential utility of affective heuristic tasks in future clin-ical assessments. (c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

Additionally, various factors, including specific job-related tasks, costs, and benefits, may impact ob-gyns' career satisfaction. Ethical concerns and career satisfaction can play a role in the quality of women's health care. This article summarizes the studies published between 2005 and 2009 by the Research Department of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which encompass ethical concerns regarding interactions with pharmaceutical representatives and patient safety/medical error reporting, as well as ob-gyn career satisfaction. Additionally, a brief discussion regarding ethical concerns in the ob-gyn field, in general, highlights key topics for the last 30 years. Ethical dilemmas continue to be of concern for ob-gyns. Familiarity with guidelines on appropriate interactions with industry is associated with lower percentages of potentially problematic relationships with pharmaceutical industries. Physicians report that the expense of patient safety initiatives is one of the top barriers for improving patient safety, followed by fear of liability. Overall, respondents reported being satisfied with their careers. However, half of the respondents reported that they were extremely concerned about the impact of professional liability costs on the duration of their careers. Increased familiarity with guidelines may lead to a decreased ob-gyn reliance on pharmaceutical representatives and free samples, whereas specific and practical tools may help them implement patient safety techniques. The easing of malpractice insurance and threat of litigation may enhance career satisfaction among ob-gyns. This article will discuss related findings in recent years.

The PEDD uses two 890 nm LEDs. Measurement of sucrose in Brix unit was carried out based on the detection of light refraction occurring at the liquid interface (the schlieren effect) between the sucrose solution and water. Phosphate was measured from the formation of calcium phosphate with turbidimetric detection. With careful design of the loading sequence and volume (sample-precipitating reagent-sample), simultaneous detection of sucrose and phosphate was accomplished with the single PEDD detector. At the optimized condition, linear calibrations from 1 to 7 Brix sucrose and from 50 to 200 mg PO43- L-1 were obtained. Good precision at lower than 2% RSD (n=10) for both analytes with satisfactory throughput of 21 injections h(-1) was achieved. The method was successfully applied for the determination of sucrose and phosphate in cola drinks. The proposed method is readily applicable for automation and is found to be an alternative method to conventional procedures for on-line quality control process in cola drink industry.

The analysis is based on the materials of the discourse of a Siberian peasant woman. She is Russian, semi-literate, born in 1909. The study showed that her speech practice contains interpersonal conflicts in the absence of intrapersonal and group conflicts. Behavioural, property, and ideological conflicts are identified with the predominance of behavioural ones. The stages of conflict communication and the tactics the speaker used are considered. The tactics mainly focus on cooperative/confrontational interaction with the opponent. At the pre-conflict stage, the speaker consistently avoids actions and statements that may cause conflict. For this purpose, she uses the tactics of refusing from potentially conflicting intentions and actions, non-interfering in conflicts between other persons, keeping silent about negative emotions in dialogues with interlocutors, refusing from verbal countering in case of disagreement with interlocutors, accepting gifts in confirmation of friendly relations; most of the tactics are cooperative. At this stage, the tactics are rarely supported by words. At the stage of open conflict, when direct speech interaction with interlocutors takes place, the speaker is extremely rarely the initiator ( the exception is a series of episodes related to the situation of her husband's betrayal and his leaving the family). When communicating with the aggressor, she relies on both cooperative and confrontational tactics, which are regularly supported by verbal and non-verbal means. As part of cooperative tactics, explanations are frequent; flattery, plea, and persuasion are also observed. When counteracting the opponent, the speaker uses a calm tone, a pleading intonation, non-judgmental proper and common nouns. Among confrontational tactics, reproach is often observed; threats (including appeals to the authorities), orders, declarative denials in case of disagreement, and categorical refusals are less frequent. Their usage is accompanied by an irritated tone, abrupt pronunciation, irony, cliched constructions (shame on you), imperatives, and a reduction in the volume of statements. At the same time, conflict-generating markers are often mitigated through euphemisms, ellipsis of negative nominations, jokes, replacement of direct criticism of interlocutors with indirect one. At the stage of post-conflict interaction, the communicants return to standard everyday communication without reproaching each other or breaking off relations (breaking off communication with the speaker's ex-spouse and the marriage wrecker is an exception). Taking into account the prevalence of cooperative tactics in the informant's discourse, it was concluded that cooperative strategy dominates in her speech behaviour as aiming to prevent confrontation with her interlocutors, to smooth it out, and to reconcile the parties. The identified features of the speaker's speech behaviour are based on the dominants of traditional folk culture (maintaining friendly relations is important for ensuring safe and comfortable coexistence in the village community) and are supported by the individual qualities of the language personality of a cooperative type, characterised by benevolence, tolerance, restraint in the manifestation of emotions, adherence to basic moral norms and etiquette.",1,1,Linguistics

Social distancing and quarantine have led to adverse mental health outcomes. COVID-19-induced economic setbacks have also likely exacerbated the psychological distress affecting broader aspects of physical and mental well-being. Remote digital health studies can provide information about the pandemic's socioeconomic, mental, and physical impact. COVIDsmart was a collaborative effort to deploy a complex digital health research study to understand the impact of the pandemic on diverse populations. We describe how digital tools were used to capture the effects of the pandemic on the overall well-being of diverse communities across large geographical areas within the state of Virginia. Objective: The aim is to describe the digital recruitment strategies and data collection tools applied in the COVIDsmart study and share the preliminary study results. Methods: COVIDsmart conducted digital recruitment, e-Consent, and survey collection through a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant digital health platform. This is an alternative to the traditional in-person recruitment and onboarding method used for studies. Participants in Virginia were actively recruited over 3 months using widespread digital marketing strategies. Six months of data were collected remotely on participant demographics, COVID-19 clinical parameters, health perceptions, mental and physical health, resilience, vaccination status, education or work functioning, social or family functioning, and economic impact. Data were collected using validated questionnaires or surveys, completed in a cyclical fashion and reviewed by an expert panel. To retain a high level of engagement throughout the study, participants were incentivized to stay enrolled and complete more surveys to further their chances of receiving a monthly gift card and one of multiple grand prizes. Results: Virtual recruitment demonstrated relatively high rates of interest in Virginia (N=3737), and 782 (21.1%) consented to participate in the study. The most successful recruitment technique was the effective use of newsletters or emails (n=326, 41.7%). The primary reason for contributing as a study participant was advancing research (n=625, 79.9%), followed by the need to give back to their community (n=507, 64.8%). Incentives were only reported as a reason among 21% (n=164) of the consented participants. Overall, the primary reason for contributing as a study participant was attributed to altruism at 88.6% (n=693). Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the need for digital transformation in research. COVIDsmart is a statewide prospective cohort to study the impact of COVID-19 on Virginians' social, physical, and mental health. The study design, project management, and collaborative efforts led to the development of effective digital recruitment, enrollment, and data collection strategies to evaluate the pandemic's effects on a large, diverse population. These findings may inform effective recruitment techniques across diverse communities and participants' interest in remote digital health studies.",0,0,Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics

Twenty-nine college students attending a basic general physics course took an attribution test and conceptual pre-test related to action-reaction concepts. As a result, twenty students with alternative conceptions were selected. Next, these students were confronted with a discrepant demonstration that contradicted their existing conceptions, then given a cognitive conflict level test (CCLT), post-test, and delayed post-test to determine their conceptual change. Those students who experienced high levels of cognitive conflict were also interviewed to find out what kinds of attribution and motivational belief affected their resolution of the conflict and successful/unsuccessful understanding of the concepts. When confronted with a discrepant event, the students who attributed successful outcomes to effort seemed to experience higher levels of cognitive conflict, compared to those students who attributed successful outcomes to task difficulty. The different attribution profiles exhibited for resolving conflict and successful/unsuccessful understanding of physics concepts were found to have a strong influence on the resolution of cognitive conflict and process of conceptual change. In addition, the profiles also appeared to be related to metacognitive and volitional strategies. High levels of cognitive conflict did not always produce conceptual change. For the conflicts to lead to change, students needed to have a perspective on effort that implied the use of a self-regulated learning strategy. Accordingly, the current findings highlighted the importance of a self-regulated cognitive conflict strategy (SRCCS) or management strategy of cognitive conflict (MSCC), indicating the need for a model of a self-regulated cognitive conflict strategy for a classroom context.",0,0,Education & Educational Research

The results showed that the as prepared ZnO NPs had a hexagonal wurtzite structure. and all the samples kept the overall crystal structure of bulk ZnO. From the Raman and photoluminescence spectra, it can be seen that the content of oxygen in different annealing atmospheres strongly influenced the crystallization and light emission of the ZnO NPs. The results revealed that the content of oxygen in air was the optimal condition for growing the ZnO NPs with the best crystalline quality and optical properties. Defect emission was significantly enhanced by annealing in Ar atmosphere, which indicated that the green defect emission was most likely clue to oxygen vacancy.

1839,2019,"Madsen, J; Mabokela, RO; Luevanos, EA",School context: implications for teachers of color,EQUALITY DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION,Workplace relationships and cultural differences; Workplace context and retention of people of color,BLIND; RACE,"Purpose - By 2026, students of color will make up 54 percent of the school-age population. Literature on recruiting and retaining teachers of color reveal that teachers of color are underrepresented in US schools (Castro et al., 2018). Cultural differences between teachers and students result in higher number of students of color being expelled or suspended, low graduation rates and lower numbers of students of color in advanced math, science and gifted courses. With an emphasis on retaining teachers of color the purpose of this paper is to examine how traditional school contexts play a role in teacher retention. Design/methodology/approach - This was a qualitative case study that examined white teachers' perceptions about their interactions with African American teachers (Merriam, 1998). A case study was useful in describing the boundaries of the school and how this type of context allowed the researchers to explore intergroup differences between both groups of teachers (Hays and Singh, 2011). Nine white teachers from predominantly white schools in the USA were interviewed (Seidman, 1998). The data were analyzed using what Glaser and Strauss (1967) call a constant comparative method. This process compared the intergroup theory with teachers' responses. Findings - Findings indicated that white teachers had little or no experience interacting with people who were racially and culturally different from them. Because of their curiosity about race, African American teachers were categorized as the black expert. White teachers asked them to speak with African American parents, give expertise on areas of discipline and chair multicultural events. Group boundaries developed rapidly as white teachers overwhelmed teachers of color with only their racial problems. African American teachers were forced into roles, which prevented them from contributing in other areas. Thus, African American teachers grew tired of only playing one aspect of their teaching. Research limitations/implications - Upon entering their schools, teachers bring with them a broad array of experiences, knowledge, skills and abilities. This results in a form of assimilation where they become like-minded to their schools' norms and values. As incoming teachers of color enter with different norms and culture, they mediate boundaries having both groups of teachers adjust to cultural differences (Madsen and Mabokela, 2013). Intergroup differences often occur due to changing demographics in schools. If teachers cannot work through these normative conflicts, it will be reflected in teacher turnover, absences, workplace disagreements and teachers of color leaving. Practical implications - If the focus is to recruit teachers of color, there needs to be an emphasis on preparing leaders on how to identify and address intergroup differences. As in Bell's (2002) study and Achinstein's (2002) research, when teachers have differences it will have influence how teachers will collaborate. Thus, teachers of color are prevented from sharing their philosophy about teaching students of color. These individuals also share the burden of being the only person who can advocate for students of color, but also serve as cultural translators for other students as well. Social implications - Future educators not only need to understand how to teach demographically diverse students, but it is important for them to understand how multicultural capital plays an inclusive role in getting all students to do academically well. The question becomes of how one teaches the importance of  humanistic commitments for all children. Originality/value - Booysen (2014) believes that identity and workplace identity research only allows for integration of divergent perspectives. More study is needed to understand how do workers navigate their identity through the workplace. Workplace identity among group members results in power discrepancies and assimilation verses the preservation of micro cultural identity. Thus, both groups often have competing goals and there is a struggle for resources. Cox (1994) believes that these tensions cause group members to center on preserving of their own culture. Hence, groups are more aware of their need to protect their cultural identity which ultimately affects retention of workers.",2,2,Business & Economics

However, few studies have examined solidarity in relation to health outcomes. The purpose of this study was to develop a psychometric tool to measure solidarity among Chinese men who have sex with men (MSM) and assess whether community solidarity relates to differences in sexually transmitted infection testing. Methods We used data from the pay-it-forward randomized controlled trial of 301 men from Beijing and Guangzhou, China. Men who have sex with men were randomized into pay-it-forward (participants receive free gonorrhea/chlamydia testing as gifts and choose to donate toward subsequent MSM's tests), pay-what you-want, and standard payment arms. After testing decision, participants completed a cross-sectional questionnaire to assess community solidarity. Factor analysis was conducted to identify dimensions of solidarity. The solidarity factors were compared across study arms and assessed against gonorrhea/chlamydia test uptake in multivariable logistic regression. Results Two hundred eighty-eight participants responded to the survey. We identified 3 latent community solidarity factors: engagement, social network support, and sense of belonging. Several items related to belonging were significantly greater among participants in the pay-it-forward scenario compared with those assigned to other scenarios. Higher sense of belonging was associated with higher odds of gonorrhea and chlamydia test uptake. Conclusions Community solidarity among MSM in China can be characterized by 3 factors: engagement, social network support, and sense of belonging. Sense of belonging was higher in the pay-it-forward intervention arm and may be associated with the uptake of gonorrhea/chlamydia test. Future studies are warranted to confirm the psychometric structure of community solidarity and further investigate behavioral mechanisms of pay it forward.",1,1,Infectious Diseases

The current study aimed to resolve these contradictory findings by conducting a systematic review and a meta-analysis using research from 2005 to 2022.MethodsData were analyzed using a multilevel modeling approach to (a) estimate the overall relationship between EI and academic success in MD programs and (b) determine whether the mean effect size varies according to country (United States vs. non-United States countries), age, EI test, EI task nature (ability-based vs. trait-based), EI subscales, and academic performance criteria (grade point average vs. examinations).ResultsFindings from 20 studies (m = 105; N = 4,227) indicated a positive correlation between EI and academic success (r = .13, 95% CI [.08, - .27], p < .01). Moderator analyses indicated that the mean effect size significantly varied according to EI tests and EI subscales. Moreover, three-level multiple regression analyses showed that between-study variance explained 29.5% of the variability in the mean effect size, whereas within-study variance explained 33.5% of the variability in the mean effect.ConclusionsOverall, the current findings show that EI is significantly, albeit weakly, related to academic success in MD programs.

This anomalous phenomenon correlates to the band bending level caused by the surface built-in electric field due to the existence of substantial oxygen vacancies. By increasing the excitation power, the enhanced neutralization effect near the surface will reduce the built-in electric field and lead to a reduction of band bending which triggers the blueshift of the UV emission.

The developed flow system is capable of providing analytical data of the dissolved CO2, sucrose, and color of a sample consecutively in real-time. The system has been carefully designed on the basis of reagent-free, meaning that no added chemicals are required for the analysis. The system first vaporizes CO2 from the soft drink in a gas-liquid separation chamber, with a channel for a flow of pure water as the CO2 acceptor. The dissolved CO2 alters the conductivity of the water stream, which is directly related to the concentration of CO2 in the soft drink. The sucrose content is measured based on the schlieren effect, the sample plug flows out of the vaporization chamber into a colorimeter with a near-infrared/light-emitting diode (NIR/LED) as light source.

The sintering temperature played an important role in the control of the crystalline phase and the particle size. The pure hcp Mg-doped Ni nanoparticles with average particle size of 6.0 nm were obtained at 320 degrees C. The results indicated that the transition from the hcp to the fcc phase occurred in the temperature range between 320 degrees C and 450 degrees C. Moreover, the VSM results showed that the hcp Mg-doped Ni nanoparticles had unique ferromagnetic and superparamagnetic behavior. The unsaturation even at 5000 Oe is one of the superparamagnetic characteristics due to the small particle size. From the ZFC and FC curves, the blocking temperature TB of the hcp sample (6.0 nm) was estimated to be 10 K. The blocking temperature was related to the size of the magnetic particles and the magnetocrystalline anisotropy constant. By theoretical calculation, the deduced particle size was 6.59 nm for hcp Mg-doped Ni nanoparticles which was in agreement with the results of XRD and TEM. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

By contrast, class heterogeneity (i.e., the extent of between-student differences) was largely unrelated to subsequent student achievement. Hence, while sorting students according to ability could benefit those sorted into high ability classes (given the benefits associated with being in a class with a high mean level), this would come at the expense of those sorted into low ability classes. Moreover, teachers in heterogeneous classes appeared to differentiate their instruction more to student capacities, which was subsequently related to higher student achievement. This study considers how class composition, in terms of between-student variability and the average level of achievement, is related to the academic development of students, and how these relationships can be explained by features of the class learning environment. At the start of secondary education, Flemish schools can decide autonomously how to group their students, leading to variation in class mean and class heterogeneity between classes. In a sample of 2,895 Flemish students from 158 classes, math achievement at the end of grade 8 was found to be unrelated to class heterogeneity, after accounting for previous achievement, intelligence, gender, and social background. Path analyses showed that class heterogeneity was positively associated with teachers' use of differentiated instruction to accommodate for differences between students, and that differentiated instruction was related to higher student achievement. Second, students were found to achieve better in classes with high average achievement. While this held true for all students, high achieving students seemed to benefit the most from being in a class with a high average level. Although class-average achievement was positively related to the academic orientation of the class, this did not explain the association between class mean level and achievement. These results suggest that, although it might be beneficial for the students in the high ability groups, grouping students in distinct classes according to ability might have little overall benefit, and emphasize that teachers' responses to student diversity might be more decisive for improving student achievement than homogenizing classes in terms of ability.",2,2,Psychology

Three iso-lipidic (5.54%) practical diets were formulated with increased starch levels at the cost of protein provision, being designated as diets LSP (13.1% starch and 38.2% protein), MSP (22.5% starch and 34.5% protein), and HSP (32.3% starch and 30.5% protein). Two hundred and forty tilapia juveniles (initial mean body weight 23 g/fish) were maintained in 250 L rectangular tanks at 20 fish per tank and were fed experimental diets to apparent satiation for 8 weeks. Approximately 24 h after the last feeding, total fish weight of each tank was measured, and the fish number was counted. Thirty-six fish per treatment (9 per tank) were sampled to analyze the body composition, blood biochemistry, biometric indices, glucose metabolic enzymatic activities, and gene expression of the liver and white muscle. Remaining fish (36 per treatment) were subjected to a glucose tolerance test. The results showed that the mean body weight of the LSP fish (145 g/fish) was higher than that of the other treatments (130-133 g/fish). Protein efficiency ratio and protein production value were improved in tilapia that were fed diets with increased starch level from 13.1% to 32.3%. The lipid percentages and glycogen concentrations in the liver and white muscle were elevated when dietary starch level was increased from 13.1% to 32.3%. Compared with the LSP fish, the expression of representative genes involved in glucose transport (glucose transporter 2, glut2), glycolysis (muscle type a of phosphofructokinase, pfkma), glycogenesis (glycogen synthase 2, gys2), and lipogenesis (acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase alpha, acc alpha; fatty acyl synthase, fas) were upregulated in the liver of the MSP fish. The mRNA levels of hepatic gluconeogenic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 2 (pck2) and glucose-6-phosphatase a2 were 0.68-and 0.37-fold lower in the HSP fish than in the LSP fish. In the white muscle, the mRNA levels of glut4, pfkma, pfkmb, gys1 and acc beta were 1.59-, 1.66-, 1.55-, 1.38- and 2.01-fold higher in the HSP fish than in the LSP fish. Activity of PFK in the liver and the muscle along with hepatic PCK activity followed similar trends to the expression of their corresponding encoding genes. Though the MSP and HSP fish obtained higher basal plasma glucose levels than the LSP fish, they took less time to restore plasma glucose after a glucose load. Thus, it was concluded that tilapia metabolically adapted well to an increase in the dietary starch level from 13.1% to 32.3% by promoting peripheral glucose storage and utilization, subsequently enhancing glucose tolerance and improving protein retention, although elevated levels of starch reduced their growth.",13,14,Fisheries; Marine & Freshwater Biology

Moreover, the interrelationships between the resulted constructs of the framework were tested using multiple and heretical regression. Findings of these analyses suggest that consumers' perception of OSCC has a weak effect on their intention to use it.

He based his explanation of these occurrences on the theory that children had been subjected to ritual sacrifice during the process of laying the foundation or completion of a house. Elevated values of strontium isotopes (Sr-87/Sr-86 > 0.7115) in MI tooth enamel and a compact bone segment of the centralfemur of the three juvenile individuals suggest that these children (grave H3/66, 6-7 years; grave H4/69, 7-8 years; grave H5/71, 5-6 years) were migrants. The Vedrovice area is located close to the NE-SW trending boundary between the Bohemian Massifcrystalline region, dominated by Palaeozoic or older granitoids and metamorphic rocks with generally high Sr-87/Sr-86 to the NW and lowland areas to the SE, dominated by Cenozoic marine sediments with low Sr-87/Sr-86 ratio. It is thus more probable that the 3 children in question originated from the NW region. Children in graves H3/66, H4/69, and H5/71 from the Neolithic site in Vedrovice were placed behind posthole huts, on their western side. The graves of113/66 and H4/69 contained no gifts, and all were non-locals, likely born northwest of Vedrovice. One of them had the arms in front of the face as if in fear. Hence it may be concluded and to speculate that these children were migrants, and were killed (or buried alive) during the founding of a field in a religious ceremony to support the growth of crops. Analyses ofmigration on the site as well as ethnographical comparisons with other primitive agricultural societiesfrom the Amazon, New Guinea and India which have traditions of comparing children to plant growth, suggest that the children were most likely sacrificed during the process offounding afield as part ofa ritual ceremony to support the growth ofcrops. Perimortem traumas on the skulls of two children from the triple burial 48-49-50/65 Nitra-Horne Kdkany (Slovakia) are evidence ofpotential violence. We can only speculate whether the children in both sites, Vedrovice and Nitra, were victims of ritualistic behaviour among the Neolithic farmers.",0,0,Anthropology

In this model, expectation leads to trust in charities, manifesting in strengthened engagement, which in its turn generates an increased amount of donations. In addition, social status moderates the effect of outcome expectation on charitable commitment. Overall, the proposed model was supported by the results of 530 responses of an online survey. Furthermore, social status moderated only the effect of egoistic expectation on charitable commitment.

A two-factor model of the two DT tests was supported in both samples based on either the fluency or originality scores, suggesting variations between different types of DT tests. Multi-group confirmatory factor analyses revealed that although the assumptions of configural and weak invariance were met for both the fluency and originality indices, the partial strong measurement invariance was marginally satisfied only for the real-world problem fluency across the two cultural groups. Further, latent mean comparison showed similar fluency between American and Chinese college students on the real-world problem test. In contrast, results from the observed mean comparison indicated higher performance of American individuals on the real-world problem fluency and originality; the opposite trend was revealed for both indices on the line meaning test.

Land-use change and political-economic shifts have shaped hunting patterns globally, even as traditional hunting practices endure across many local socio-cultural contexts. The widespread expansion of oil palm cultivation, and associated urbanization, alters land-use patterns, ecological processes, economic relationships, access to land and social practices. 2. In particular, we focus on the socio-ecological dynamics between KadazandusunMurut (KDM) hunters in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo, and bearded pigs (Sus barbatus; Malay: 'babi hutan'), the favoured game animal for non-Muslim communities throughout much of Borneo. We conducted 38 semi-structured interviews spanning over 50 hr with bearded pig hunters, asking them about contemporary hunting practices and motivations, changes in hunting practices, changes in pig behaviour, and patterns of animal protein consumption in village and urban contexts. 3. Amidst widespread land-use change, primarily driven by oil palm expansion, respondents reported substantially different characteristics of hunting in oil palm plantations as compared to hunting in forests. Additionally, 17 of 38 hunters- including 71% (10/14) of hunters who started hunting before 1985, compared to 26% (6/23) of hunters who started hunting in 1985 or later-mentioned that bearded pigs are behaving in a more skittish or fearful way as compared to the past. Our respondents also reported reductions in hunting frequency and wild meat consumption in urban contexts as compared to rural contexts. 4. However, despite these substantial changes in hunting and dietary practices, numerous KDM hunting motivations, hunting techniques and socio-cultural traditions have endured over the last several decades. For some, bearded pig meat remains deeply tied to food provision, gifting and sharing customs, and cultural components of celebrations and feasts. 5. Oil palm has cultivated new hunting practices that differ from those in forests, and has potentially contributed to altered bearded pig behaviour due to increased hunting accessibility. Together, oil palm and urbanization are helping reshape the KDM-bearded pig socio-ecological system. In light of these reshaped connections, we recommend location-specific management approaches that ensure fair access to the dietary and social benefits of bearded pig hunting while preserving the critical conservation needs of bearded pig populations and habitat.

The role of private prenatal care on the continuity of care in Serbian public maternity hospitals,BIRTH-ISSUES IN PERINATAL CARE,birth; continuity of care; favors; private; public; Serbia,BIRTH; PAYMENTS; WOMEN; GIFTS,"Background For pregnant and birthing women, maintaining a relationship with the same health care practitioner is critical to establishing a sense of safety. In postsocialist Serbia, where care is fragmented and depersonalized, this continuity is often missing. Patients are frequently handed over to new practitioners, sometimes without even knowing the name of the person overseeing their care. In response, many women turn to the private sector to keep the same practitioner across their prenatal period and their birth by establishing a personal connection within the hospital that they believe will shield them from mistreatment during childbirth. Methods Data presented in this paper were collected through participant observation in one public maternity hospital and one public primary care center in Serbia; semistructured interviews with 14 physicians; and semistructured interviews with 80 women who had given birth in one public maternity hospital in Serbia. Results Public maternity hospital physicians who supplement their income working in the private sector have the power to blur the distinctions between favors and services. They offer continuity of personalized care to their private clients/patients once they enter the public system, and they themselves obtain social and economic security unavailable to those working in only one sector. At the same time, there is evidence that personalized continuity of care does not actually shield women from mistreatment in hospitals. Conclusions The private sector is reshaping existing informal strategies and blurring the lines between formal and informal payments. In the postsocialist context, consumer practices are not separate from, but entangled with, informality. Neoliberalism has not brought about empowerment and eliminated informality, but has instead further exacerbated existing inequalities in maternity care in Eastern Europe.",0,0,Nursing; Obstetrics & Gynecology; Pediatrics

Sugar dating is described by these sites as dating arrangements based on an exchange of intimacy and companionship for financial or other forms of support. Given that sex is often part of the arrangements, claims are widespread, yet disputed, that sugar dating is a form of prostitution. Based on interviews and a survey questionnaire, this article maps the practice of heterosexual sugar dating in Sweden as described by sugar babies and sugar daddies themselves. It shows a striking diversity in regard to what sugar dating means for participants, both in terms of what they do when sugar dating and in terms of how money and/or other material goods are involved in arrangements. A further key difference between sugar dating arrangements is whether sugar babies enter them for purely instrumental reasons or enjoy them in and of themselves. Although not all kinds of sugar dating include sex, we argue that sugar dating sites should be seen as key actors in the expansion of the sex (and intimacy) industry, drawing on and articulating pre-existing tendencies within it.",3,3,Sociology

In this study, different concentrations of abiotic (25-200 mu M methyl jasmonate-MeJA and salicylic acid-SA) or biotic elicitors (1-5 g/L yeast extract-YE and Fusarium biomass) were used as plant elicitors, in order to investigate their influences on cell growth and gypenosides accumulation in G. pentaphyllum suspension cells. Suspension cells were grown on a MS medium containing 2.0 mg/L KIN and 0.5 mg/L IBA, with initial inoculum sizes of 3 g and shaking speeds of 120 rpm for 18 days. Gypenoside and Rb1 contents were measured by colorimetric and HPLC methods. Among three elicitors, SA was suitable for gypenosides accumulation in individual treatment. The cell biomass had the same values in elicitated and control suspension cells. Gypenosides content in cells treated with 100 mu M salicylic acid after 6 days of culture reached a maximum value of 79.721 mg gypenoside/g dry biomass (including 0.093 mg ginsenoside Rb1/mg dry weight), which was 2.18-folds higher than that of the natural product.

Students, however, live in a visual world which provides them with a great opportunity to apply a sociological imagination to their everyday lives (Mills, 1959). Visual sociology has thus gained increased legitimacy in the social sciences in the last decades. Visual media, such as photographs and movies, have been found to be an effective tool for teaching sociology, as well as for sociological research and analysis, as they provide credible representations of society. One of the strengths of utilizing visual media for sociological analysis is that the researcher can slow the world down, freeze time and study particular moments through visual media content with the intention of raising awareness of a particular time and place. Visual media also provide the researcher with access to multiple socio-historical sites, which he/she usually cannot access through other means. It is argued that through the analysis of visual media the researcher can enhance his/her understanding of the relationship between the individual and society and develop a sociological imagination. Photographs are often meant to satisfy three basic needs; to capture memories, to show something beautiful and to demonstrate the truth. Visual sociology is mainly concerned with the truth of photographs. Through photographs the viewer can see some aspects of the truth, but not necessarily the whole truth. Photographs are, however, believed to show a more realistic perspective of reality and the everyday lives of people within societies than most other art forms. In this paper I make a case for social science teachers to make use of photo essays as class assignments, where students take their own photographs and analyze them from a sociological perspective, in order to help students learn sociology and to develop a sociological imagination of society and their everyday lives. Photo essays, as introduced in this paper, conform to many of the core aims of the Icelandic national curriculum guide for compulsory and upper secondary schools, such as the emphasis on diverse teaching methods from where students should gain autonomy, accountability and spark their creative spirits, inside and outside the classroom. Thus, in this paper I analyze four of my own photographs through a sociological imagination to illustrate the method of using visual sociology in teaching and societal analysis. The main aims of the paper are: firstly to illustrate sociological theories and concepts through the use of photographs, and in particular photo essays; second, to help the reader develop a sociological imagination of society; third, to draw the reader's attention to various social issues; and finally to encourage teachers of sociology to utilize visual media in their teaching. The photographs are analyzed through the four themes which Sutherland and Feltey (2013) suggested for a sociological analysis of visual media: institutions, inequality, interaction, and identity, and they represent both the macro and micro levels of society. The first photograph represents capitalist society and provides insight into the city structure and city life in downtown Chicago. The photo, named The Triumph of Capitalism illustrates the social stratification of society, as a social institution, where the capitalist ideology is represented as victorious. The second photograph, named False Needs represents consumer society where it shows a corpus of used gift wrappings and waste in the aftermath of a Christmas Eve celebration at an affluent Icelandic home. The photograph highlights inequality where an affluent Western society like Iceland is represented by the overconsumption of consumer goods, to satisfy what Marcuse (1964) termed as false needs, while poorer societies cannot attend to the basic needs of their citizens who live in poverty and hunger. The third photograph, named The Ties of Generations, represents the problems of inter-generational communication within modern technological society. The photograph shows three males of different generations posing for a photo outside a baseball game at the Chicago Cubs stadium. While the argument of the analysis suggests there is decreased communication between the elders and the youngsters in modern society, the photo shows how sports can connect individuals of different ages through a common, real-life event. The last photograph looks behind the scenes in the life of a cancer patient, representing normal society. The photograph named Behind the Scenes shows this woman's anxiousness about her self-identity after losing her hair due to cancer treatment, with the argument that the effect of the hair loss on the patient's identity has even more damaging effect than the cancer itself. The four photographs analyzed in this paper provide the viewer with different insights into everyday life in modern societies. The photographs, however, all show how social structures - which people do not necessarily acknowledge in their everyday lives - constrain and affect the actions, perceptions and emotions of people in their daily lives. Thus, as argued in this paper, the analysis of visual media, such as photographs, can provide students and other audiences with a meaningful understanding of society, increased criticism of social issues, and, furthermore, can provoke new questions about the relationship between the individual and society. In other words, such analysis is an effective tool to enhance students' sociological imagination inside and outside the classroom.",0,0,Education & Educational Research

Literature stemming from different disciplines has been reviewed to summarize the main arguments in support of each of the three perspectives. Subsequently, these arguments are mapped on a continuum ranging from completely innate to completely acquired. We argue that an organization's position on this continuum entails important implications for its design of talent management practices, which we discuss extensively. By providing guidelines on how an organization's talent management system can be shaped in accordance with their respective talent definition, this paper is particularly useful to HR practitioners.

In total, 130 photos were selected for analysis; twenty of them were chosen to represent the four created categories, representing moments of hospitality in cosmopolitan cities: human, architectonic, environmental and hostility. It is noticeable that, although hospitality is a relationship set among two or more individuals, it does not become effective in the absence of adjacent factors, such as architecture and/or the environment. This outcome also reinforces the thin line between hospitality and hostility, to the extent that the perception of hospitality is dependent on hostility. Thus, we expect to contribute to the reasoning about hospitality in contemporary society, which is marked by exclusion, aggressiveness, hostility and, even, moments of inhospitality.",1,1,Social Sciences - Other Topics

The methods of how evidence of these seed-carrying processes was collected are presented here. A systematic and sequential observational technique in three steps is suggested to facilitate understanding the germination, growth and development processes of the different seeds in the microecosystem explored.

Depression is one of the common mental illnesses. However, in low- and middle-income countries, relatively little research has been undertaken to assess the prevalence and the factors that contribute to depression among prisoners. Aim: This paper aims to assess the burden and predictors of depression among male inmates in a central jail in Odisha. Method: This cross-sectional study was conducted among male prisoners in one of the central jails of Odisha. A total of 146 samples were selected using a random sampling method and 105 completed the interview. The socio-demographic characteristics and PHQ-9 scale were used for data collection. Descriptive and inferential statistics were applied for data analysis. Result: In the overall study sample, 25.7% of inmates were diagnosed with moderately severe depression, and 27.6% were diagnosed with severe depression. Binary logistic regression showed that higher education, being accused of a crime, and having low social support are all significant predictors of depression in prisoners.

In contrast to Ivuna and Orgueil, which each contain similar to 70 nmol/g of amino acids in acid-hydrolyzed, water extracts, both heated Yamato CI meteorites contain only low levels of amino acids that were primarily L-enantiomers of proteinogenic amino acids, indicating that they are likely to be terrestrial in origin.

However, few have examined the contribution of low-frequency coding variants on a genome-wide level. OBJECTIVE To identify low-frequency coding variants that affect susceptibility to AD, FTD, and PSP. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We used the Illumina HumanExome BeadChip array to genotype a large number of variants (most of which are low-frequency coding variants) in a cohort of patients with neurodegenerative disease (224 with AD, 168 with FTD, and 48 with PSP) and in 224 control individuals without dementia enrolled between 2005-2012 from multiple centers participating in the Genetic Investigation in Frontotemporal Dementia and Alzheimer's Disease (GIFT) Study. An additional multiancestral replication cohort of 240 patients with AD and 240 controls without dementia was used to validate suggestive findings. Variant-level association testing and gene-based testing were performed. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Statistical association of genetic variants with clinical diagnosis of AD, FTD, and PSP. RESULTS Genetic variants typed by the exome array explained 44%, 53%, and 57% of the total phenotypic variance of AD, FTD, and PSP, respectively. An association with the known AD gene ABCA7 was replicated in several ancestries (discovery P = .0049, European P = .041, African American P = .043, and Asian P = .027), suggesting that exonic variants within this gene modify AD susceptibility. In addition, 2 suggestive candidate genes, DYSF (P = 5.53 x 10(-5)) and PAXIP1 (P = 2.26 x 10(-4)), were highlighted in patients with AD and differentially expressed in AD brain. Corroborating evidence from other exome array studies and gene expression data points toward potential involvement of these genes in the pathogenesis of AD. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Low-frequency coding variants with intermediate effect size may account for a significant fraction of the genetic susceptibility to AD and FTD. Furthermore, we found evidence that coding variants in the known susceptibility gene ABCA7, as well as candidate genes DYSF and PAXIP1, confer risk for AD.",29,29,Neurosciences & Neurology

These syndromes are characterized by growth deficiency, radial ray defects, red rashes, and higher predisposition to malignancy, especially osteosarcomas. Within the RecQ family, RECQ4 is the least characterized, and its role in DNA replication and repair remains unknown. We have identified several DNA binding sites within RECQ4. Two are located at the N-terminus and one is located within the conserved helicase domain. N-terminal domains probably cooperate with one another and promote the strong annealing activity of RECQ4. Surprisingly, the region spanning 322-400 aa shows a very high affinity for branched DNA substrates, especially Holliday junctions.

The improved sensing performance is associated with surface morphology, high porosity and high surface-to-volume ratio of one-dimensional NFs.",14,14,Engineering; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Materials Science; Physics

Students need to learn several skills, such as creativity, critical thinking, collaboration, and communication (the 4 Cs). Creativity, especially, is an essential skill in a complex and unforeseeable world/era, and an important step in any effort to enhance creativity is to identify students' creative strengths and relative weaknesses. This review aims to offer school psychologists and other educators such as teachers, policymakers, and curriculum designers a comprehensive and practical guide to one of the most well-known creativity assessments-the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking (TTCT) that was developed by E. Paul Torrance in the 1960s. The paper discusses the history, components, training, psychometric properties, and uses of the TTCT. Contrary to the notion that the TTCT is only a measure of divergent thinking skills, the current article presents its other uses. It is the authors' hope that teachers, school psychologists, and other educators will find the information reported in this article useful to better understand the TTCT and use it most effectively.",1,1,Psychology

Its originality lies in the fact that envy is seen as an unpleasant emotion and feeling, and a negative attitude, projected onto another person who, compared to the object of envy, has certain advantages, opportunities, or is in a more favourable position (social, psychological, physical, financial). Besides, the article analyzes theoretical-empirical and experimental studies on envy, its neuropsychological aspects and influence on the functioning of the brain. It shows prerequisites (genetic and social) for envy as an emotional experience and analyzes the role of social comparison in generating and consolidating envy. The article discusses describes the neuropsychological localization of envy in brain structures and the role of mirror neurons in the formation of envious impulses. It also theoretically proves that envy as a mental reaction is a situational and short-term feeling of dissatisfaction aroused by someone else's possessions, qualities or luck, which is manifested in a strong desire to have them for oneself right away. Social comparison (not in one's favour) causes a profound drop in self-esteem, which the brain perceives as physical pain. This triggers specific mechanisms of imaginary psychological compensation when someone else's defeat is perceived as one's victory. Short-term envious reactions are based on the natural action mechanism of mirror neurons in the brain that come from imitative desire, important for survival. Neuropsychologists have traced the overactivation of mirror neurons responsible for assessment and motivation in those people whose experience of envy is frequent and long-term. The article suggests possible ways of envy psychocorrection based on the neuropsychological mechanisms of its formation.",0,0,Neurosciences & Neurology

Among them, the homology with S. spectabilis was the highest, reaching 99.9, together with curved hyphal morphology and biochemical tests, allowed us to identify strain L20190601 as S. spectabilis. The red pigment produced by S. spectabilis strain L20190601 was structurally identified. An acid-base color reaction assay showed that when this pigment was dissolved in a solution at pH 3.0 and 9.0, the color of the solution was red and yellow, respectively. In addition, the analysis of absorption spectra revealed that at pH 8.0 and 3.0, the maximum absorption peaks were at 466 and 531 nm, respectively. These results are consistent with the spectral absorption characteristics of metacycloprodigiosin reported in the literature. Moreover, the retention time of purified pigments was identical to those of standard metacycloprodigiosin solutions. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that the molecular weight of the red compound was 392.2 [M + H](+). Finally, metacycloprodigiosin was found to be effective against eight clinically common pathogens: Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pyogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus typhi, Candida albicans, and Trichophyton rubrum. In summary, metacycloprodigiosin exhibited strong antibacterial activity and a broad antibacterial spectrum, and thus is a promising compound for the development of a new type of antibacterial drug.",4,4,Microbiology

Additionally, we examined if the teacher-student relationship quality was more important for the engagement of at-risk high-ability students (i.e. students with a low SES background or students with a diagnosed learning disability or developmental disorder). A sample of 403 Flemish high-ability students (IQ >= 120) reported on their behavioral and emotional (dis)engagement using scales developed by Skinner and colleagues (2009) and their relationship with their teachers using the People in My Life questionnaire (Cook et al. 1995). Multilevel growth curve analyses showed that positive and negative teacher-student relationships both contributed to the development of high-ability students' behavioral and emotional (dis)engagement. Analyses also revealed that negative relationships had a stronger effect on the behavioral disengagement of low SES students.

Melt granulation, as an environmentally friendly and cost-effective method, has recently been recognized as a promising co-processing technique. The aim of the present study was to prepare lipid-based co-processed excipients by in situ fluidized bed melt granulation and to investigated their suitability for direct compression process. Lactose monohydrate was co-processed with glyceryl dibehenate (Compritol (R) 888 ATO) or glyceryl palmitostearate (Precirol (R) ATO 5), as lipophilic meltable binders. Besides the flowability testing, dynamic compaction analysis was applied for thorough investigation into the tableting properties of developed co processed excipients. Solid state characterization, performed by means of XRPD and DRIFT, confirmed the absence of chemical changes of the single components of co-processed excipients. Co-processed excipients showed improved flowability in comparison with single ingredients and corresponding physical mixtures. Novel co-processed excipients were found to have better tabletability profiles than physical mixtures of the ingredients, and were able to retain acceptable tensile strength values at high content of paracetamol in tableting mixture. Tablets with high tensile strength could be obtained with less work of compression needed in comparison with the commercial lactose-based excipients.

Here, we report that the paralogous transcription factors PAX1 and PAX9 differentially drive UE, depending on the presence or absence of SOX9-driven transactivation. In the developing vertebral column, PAX1/9 expression was inversely correlated with Acan expression. Moreover, PAX1/9 was co-expressed with SOX9/5/6 in the intervertebra I mesenchyme and the inner annulus fibrosus (AF), and with SOX9 in the outer AF. Significant Acan upregulation was observed during chondrification of Pax1-silenced AF cells, while, Acan was significantly downregulated by persistent expression of Pax1 in cartilage. Deletion of UE using CRISPR/Cas9 resulted in similar to 30% and similar to 40% reduction of Acan expression in cartilage and the AF, respectively. In the UE, PAX1/9 acts as weak transactivators through a PAX1/9-binding site partially overlapped with a SOX9-binding site. In the presence of SOX9, which otherwise drives robust Acan expression along with SOX9/6, PAX1/9 competes with SOX9 for occupancy of the binding site, resulting in reduced transactivation of Acan. Coimmunoprecipitation revealed the physical interaction of Pax1 with SOX9. Thus, transactivation of the UE is differentially regulated by concerted action of PAX1/9, SOX9, and SOX5/6 in a context-dependent manner.",11,13,Science & Technology - Other Topics

Many studies have shown that the lack of interest in learning is a fundamental reason students become underachievers. With the rapid development of information technology, games have gradually integrated into our lives. Gamification has been applied to stimulate students learning interests and strengthen their motivation by incorporating game design elements in educational environments. This paper first elaborates on the current trends of gamified learning and the transformation of underachievers. Next, this research reviews the theoretical basis and defines the relevant concepts of gamified learning. Then, through questionnaires and interviews, the paper investigates the learning status of the underachievers with the gamified platform - GamiClass based on ADDIE instructional design model and Grasha Learning Styles. A total of 10 underachievers among 76 Raffles University Malaysia Innovation module students were selected for practical analysis. This experiment investigated gamification feasibility and effectiveness in the transformation of underachievers. This research found that gamification could effectively improve the underachievers' learning interest. Game elements such as meaning, onboard tutorial, social pressure and guild/teams are necessary for a gamified learning platform to motivate underachievers in online lesson participation.",3,3,Computer Science

The vast majority of commercial organ providers are economically marginal men, thus throwing into question conventional wisdom regarding the gendered nature of human trafficking in which most trafficked persons are presumed to be female. This article examined the motives of men who sell kidneys in Manila's black organ market and their ongoing negotiations when their aspirations are not fulfilled. I suggest that family considerations figure prominently amongst many of the men, who attempt to use the money from the sale of a kidney as a livelihood or family security strategy. Narratives of economically marginal men in the Philippines about the commercial value of their body parts are situated in discourses of traditional Philippines ideas about masculinity, particularly concerning the male breadwinner and also about heroism. Thus, although an emotionally and relationally complex decision, selling a kidney nonetheless allows these men to attempt to reclaim their masculine roles, but often with contradictory outcomes.",13,13,Geography; Women's Studies

In addition, all gravitated to Milwaukee, a speed skating Mecca with ideal training facilities, where they crossed and joined paths. Regarding family, all were born into skating or athletic families and were raised by supportive and guiding parents who were involved but not pushy.

Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to examine the factorial structure. Among the tested models, a second-order factor model, in which the three ability factors serve as indicators of a general factor, provided an acceptable model fit to the data. Moreover, measurement invariance across gender and grades were supported, which suggests the mean scores of analytical, creative, and practical abilities are comparable in this research. The criterion-related validity analysis suggests that the battery and its three subscales have good criterion validity. The scale reliability analysis shows that the Cronbach's alpha and the McDonald's omega value of the whole test were .84 and .87, respectively, indicating the scale's internal reliability is good. For ability differences among grades, students' analytical and practical abilities increase across all grades, while creativity presents an upward trend from grade 4 to 6, followed by a downward trend from grade 6 to 7, and an increase from grade 7 to 8.

We also examined how various labels are used in PF literature and how the terms differ from one another. Using the random-effects model, the results showed that PF and creativity were significantly correlated, r = .22 (95% confidence interval [.11, .32], p = < .001), but with high heterogeneity. Moreover, 3 of 5 moderators were significant and explained the variation in the mean effect size: (a) the various indices of divergent thinking, (b) the PF domain, and (c) participants' age. An analysis of variance showed that using different labels in PF and creativity research did not significantly alter study results.

In a periodic system, like a harmonic oscillator, the trajectory does not depend so much on the initial conditions, as a small change in the initial conditions only leads to a small change in the trajectory. However, in a chaotic system, a small change in the initial conditions significantly modifies the time evolution thereafter. The current paper reveals that few physics-major undergraduate students understand the importance of the initial conditions when solving equations of motion. In particular, no one could perceive the existence of a chaotic motion. Accordingly, an experimental program is proposed that demonstrates the basic nature of chaos using a double pendulum, a well-known chaotic oscillator. Observation of the motion intuitively teaches that its sensitive dependence on the initial conditions makes it difficult to predict a chaotic time evolution over a long period of time.",0,0,Education & Educational Research

We histologically examined the effects of donepezil on neuronal injury induced by ischemia reperfusion. Intravenous and intravitreous treatment with donepezil 15 min prior to ischemia dramatically reduced the retinal damage. The protective effect of donepezil in the ganglion cell layer was not affected by mecamylamine, a nicotinic acetylcholine-receptor antagonist, nor scopolamine, a muscarinic acetylcholine-receptor antagonist. The protective effect of donepezil in the inner plexiform layer was reduced not by mecamylamine, but by scopolamine. Neostigmine, a choline-esterase inhibitor, and pilocarpine, a muscarinic acetylcholine-receptor agonist, have protective effects in the inner plexiform layer and the inner nuclear layer. These results suggest that not only the activation of acetylcholine receptors but also a mechanism unrelated to acetylcholine-esterase inhibition contribute to the protective effect of donepezil on the ganglion cells in the ischemic reperfused rat retina.

We histologically investigated the effects of capsaicin and SA13353, TRPV1 agonists, on retinal injuiy induced by intravitreal N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA; 200 nmol/eye) in rats in vivo. Under ketamine/xylazine anesthesia, male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to intravitreal NMDA injection. Capsaicin (5.0 nmol/eye) was intravitreally admianeously with NMDA injection. SA13353 (10 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally administered 15 min before NMDA injection. Morphometric evaluation at 7 days after NMDA injection showed that intravitreal NMDA injection resulted in ganglion cell loss. Capsaicin and SA13353 almost completely prevented this damage. Treatment with capsazepine (TRPV1 antagonist, 0.5 nmol/eye), CGRP (8-37) (calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist, 0.5 pmol/eye), or RP67580 (Lachykinin NK1 receptor antagonist, 0.5 nmol/eye) almost completely negated the protective effect of capsaicin in the NMDA-injecLed rats.

Infrared spectra reveal that two typical absorbed peaks occur in their corresponding positions. However, the stretching mode exhibits an obvious shift to low frequency and its intensity gets enhanced in Dy- and Er-doping samples. In Raman spectra, the stretching mode shows the same shift, while the Jahn-Teller mode remains invariant. The A-site substitution with other elements changes the average ionic radius and induces cation disorder, causing a decrease of the Curie temperature and the formation of spin-cluster-glass. Except for Sm-doping sample, the field dependence of magnetization at different temperatures shows a similar magnetization process indicating that the low concentration substitution with 10 % magnetic ions cannot signally influence the magnetic exchange interaction on B-site sublattice. Based on the analysis of electronic transport in metallic regime, we find that the main factor for impacting the electronic transport is from the variation of crystal lattice and the induced cationic disorder, regardless of magnetic or non-magnetic substitution.",28,31,Materials Science

OBJECTIVE To determine the safety and efficacy of a target INR of 1.8 vs 2.5 for VTE prophylaxis after orthopedic surgery. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The randomized Genetic Informatics Trial (GIFT) of Warfarin to Prevent Deep Vein Thrombosis enrolled 1650 patients aged 65 years or older initiating warfarin for elective hip or knee arthroplasty at 6 US medical centers. Enrollment began in April 2011 and follow-up concluded in October 2016. INTERVENTIONS In a 2 x 2 factorial design, participantswere randomized to a target INR of 1.8 (n= 823) or 2.5 (n= 827) and to either genotype-guided or clinically guidedwarfarin dosing. For the first 11 days of therapy, open-labelwarfarin dosingwas guided by aweb application. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcomewas the composite of VTE (within 60 days) or death (within 30 days). Participants underwent screening duplex ultrasound postoperatively. The hypothesis was that an INR target of 1.8 would be noninferior to an INR target of 2.5, using a noninferiority margin of 3% for the absolute risk of VTE. Secondary end points were bleeding and INR values of 4 or more. RESULTS Among 1650 patients who were randomized (mean age, 72.1 years; 1049 women [63.6%]; 1502 white [91.0%]), 1597 (96.8%) received at least 1 dose of warfarin and were included in the primary analysis. The rate of the primary composite outcome of VTE or death was 5.1%(41 of 804) in the low-intensity-warfarin group (INR target, 1.8) vs 3.8% (30 of 793) in the standard-treatment-warfarin group (INR target, 2.5), for a difference of 1.3%(1-sided 95% CI, -infinity to 3.05%, P=.06 for noninferiority). Major bleeding occurred in 0.4% of patients in the low-intensity group and 0.9% of patients in the standard-intensity group, for a difference of -0.5%(95% CI, -1.6% to 0.4%). The INR values of 4 or more occurred in 4.5% of patients in the low-intensity group and 12.2% of the standard-intensity group, for a difference of -7.8%(95% CI, -10.5% to -5.1%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among older patients undergoing hip or knee arthroplasty and receiving warfarin prophylaxis, an international normalized ratio goal of 1.8 compared with 2.5 did not meet the criterion for noninferiority for risk of the composite outcome of VTE or death. However, the trial may have been underpowered to meet this criterion and further research may be warranted.",7,7,General & Internal Medicine

The present study examined the importance of olfactory function in glucose kinetics following ingestion behavior in a simplified experimental scenario. We applied a conventional glucose tolerance test to rats with and without olfactory function and analyzed subsequent blood glucose (BG) curves in detail. The loss of olfactory input due to experimental damage to the olfactory mucosa induced a marked decrease in the area under the BG curve. Exposure to grapefruit odor and its main component, limonene, both of which activate the sympathetic nerves, before glucose loading also greatly depressed the BG curve. Pre-loading exposure to lavender odor, a parasympathetic activator, stabilized the BG level. These results suggest that olfactory function is important for proper glucose kinetics after glucose intake and that certain fragrances could be utilized as tools for controlling BG levels.",5,5,General & Internal Medicine

The decrement of endogenous DDR2 represses osteoblastic marker gene expression and osteogenic differentiation in murine preosteoblastic cells, but the functions of DDR2 in chondrogenic cellular proliferation remain unclear. To better understand the role of DDR2 signaling in cellular proliferation in endochondral ossification, we inhibited Ddr2 expression via the inhibitory effect of miRNA on Ddr2 mRNA (miDdr2) and analyzed the cellular proliferation and differentiation in the prechondrocyte ATDC5 cell lines. To investigate DDR2's molecular role in endochondral cellular proliferation in vivo, we also produced transgenic mice in which the expression of truncated, kinase dead (1(D) DDR2 protein is induced, and evaluated the DDR2 function in cellular proliferation in chondrocytes. Although the miDdr2-transfected ATDC5 cell lines retained normal differentiation ability. DDR2 reduction finally promoted cellular proliferation in proportion to the decreasing ratio of Ddr2 expression, and it also promoted earlier differentiation to cartilage cells by insulin induction. The layer of hypertrophic chondrocytes in KD Ddr2 transgenic mice was not significantly thicker than that of normal littermates, but the layer of proliferative chondrocytes in KD-Ddr2 transgenic mice was significantly thicker than that of normal littermates. Taken together, our data demonstrated that DDR2 might play a local and essential role in the proliferation of chondrocytes. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

INFLUENCE OF THEOSOPHICAL-ANTHROPOSOPHICAL THOUGHT ON CONTEMPORARIES",FOLIA LINGUISTICA ET LITTERARIA,Rudolf Steiner; Theosophy; Anthroposophy; Albert Schweitzer; Christian Morgenstern; Hermann Hesse; Franz Kafka; spirituality; Waldorf pedagogy,,"The paper seeks to critically present the eccentric philosopher Rudolf Steiner and to point out his influence on famous contemporaries such as Albert Schweitzer, Christian Morgenstern, Hermann Hesse and Franz Kafka. Unlike the ruling positivist approach and scientific rationalism, which he believed could only reach the apparent form of things, this Austrian thinker created his own system, based on a synthesis of Western philosophy of idealism, Christianity and Hindu teachings with Gnosticism, which he called anthroposophy. Above all, he wanted to point out the possibility of overcoming the limits of empirical knowledge and encourage contemporaries to use their latent potentials on the path of spiritual cognition. With this teaching, he managed to attract many supporters, at least for a while, especially those in search of a deeper understanding of reality and prone to self-analysis. Steiner claimed that he had first supernatural experiences and unusual cognitions early on, and as a result of these he became aware of the existence of two parallel worlds: an external, material one, accessible to the senses and known to all, and another, otherworldly and spiritual, which was equally real for him. Misunderstood by those around him and declared an odd character, he withdrew and devoted himself to science. During his schooling, the young Steiner discovered his fascination with geometry, claiming later that the laws of geometry were the ones that gave him confirmation of the existence of a parallel world, inaccessible to sensory perception. A few years later he read Kant's The Critique of Pure Reason with the same zeal, not realizing that the study of this philosopher would influence his professional path. Kant's philosophy posed a new challenge; although Steiner found in it an inexhaustible source of inspiration, he rejected Kant's understanding of the possibilities of reason and limits of knowledge, which he sought to expand in a Faustian manner throughout his life. Guided by this idea of expansion, he believed that it was first of all necessary to introduce reforms in schooling, and therefore advocated an education system that would perceive learning as a continuous process, one that would encourage students to independently discover the world around them, but also themselves as people. He believed that this combination of pedagogy and ethics took into account all aspects of importance for individual development (physical, emotional, intellectual and social) and contributed to the education of the individual into a free and morally responsible person. Steiner first applied his concept in the school he personally founded in Stuttgart in 1919, and it is now successfully applied in many Waldorf schools around the world. After finishing high school, Steiner himself continued his education in Vienna, where, following his father's wish, he enrolled at the Technical Faculty. During his studies, he became acquainted for the first time with the character and work of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, who, along with Kant, had a crucial influence on the formation of his attitudes. Although Goethe was primarily known as a classic writer of German literature, Steiner's attention was captured by his research in the field of natural sciences. He was especially intrigued by Goethe's specific approach to the phenomena of nature, with which, as he claimed, he wanted to discover and realize the true essence of the phenomena. From 1890, Steiner collected material for a critical edition of Goethe's collected works in the field of natural sciences. In 1892, he defended his dissertation titled Truth and Science in Rostock, and the following year he published The Philosophy of Freedom, which gradually led to a change in his attitudes. The year 1900 marked a turning point in Steiner's life. After moving to Berlin, he accepted various jobs: he worked as an editor of the literary magazine Magazin fur Literatur, a theater critic and playwright, while at the same time giving numerous lectures, including a presentation at the Association of German Theosophists in memory of the recently deceased Friedrich Nietzsche. Steiner, who had earlier on had the opportunity to meet Nietzsche personally, had already published a work dedicated to the famous philosopher, titled Friedrich Nietzsche, a Fighter Against His Time (1895), in which he primarily welcomed Nietzche's idea of the Ubermensch, a sovereign, highly moral individual free from all dogmas, one that is capable of using their spiritual potentials. Relying on Nietzsche's ethical idealism, Christian and Eastern mysticism and Plato's ethics based on the principles of mathematics, which, as Newton claimed, enable the discovery of higher concepts and truths about the divine nature of the world, Steiner defined the postulates of his controversial anthroposophy in 1913, to his mind the only science that enabled man to use his mind independently of sensory impressions and provided him with a basis for the cognition of pure ideas. Convinced that, owing to a solid theoretical background derived from natural sciences and a precise methodology, he had managed to separate his teaching from the esoteric and elevate it to a higher, scientific level, Steiner claimed that anthroposophy achieved a synthesis of science and spirituality, one capable of providing answers to the essential questions of nature and human existence. Tempting ideas like these, as well as his charismatic appearance, irresistibly attracted a wide circle of admirers, and Steiner's popularity grew from year to year. There never seemed to be enough tickets for his lectures, and he held over 6000 of them. Among the listeners were primarily members of the upper classes, merchants, bankers, prominent ladies from high society, but also numerous intellectuals such as Albert Schweitzer and prominent writers such as Christian Morgenstern, Hermann Hesse and Franz Kafka. The friendship of Albert Schweitzer and Rudolf Steiner is evidenced by the records of the famous Nobel laureate, but also by the testimonies of their mutual friends and acquaintances. From the first meeting at the conference of the Theosophical Society in Strasbourg in 1902, the two remained in constant contact until Steiner's death. Although they did not advocate the same ideas, they shared the belief that the basic unrecognized problem of their time was the decline of spirituality in culture. After exchanging opinions, they realized that they had both taken on a lifelong mission of working for the emergence and development of a true culture enlivened by the ideal of encouraging people to become truly thinking beings. They parted with this consciousness of belonging together without arranging for another meeting. But the consciousness of togetherness remained in place for the rest of their lives (Vogele 114). A sincere friendship connected the poet Christian Morgenstern and Steiner. Although they had been moving in the same circles from 1897, when Steiner took over the editorship of the magazine Magazin fur Literatur, the philosopher and the poet did not meet in person until 1909. Ever since attending Steiner's lectures in Berlin for the first time, Morgenstern recognized his own aspirations in Steiner's teachings and approached the study of theosophy with critical skepticism (which Steiner himself advocated). Delighted with his character and work, he dedicated several poems written at that time to the Austrian philosopher. Morgenstern also expressed his deep affection for Steiner in a letter dated April 6, 1909, asking him to become a member of the Theosophical Society. Steiner later referred to this kind and modest letter in his speech on April 10, 1914, ten days after the poet's death, thus paying tribute to a deceased friend. After Steiner's telegraphic confirmation, Morgenstern joined him in Koblenz and followed him all over Germany in the following months. In May of the same year, he attended the meetings of the Theosophical Society and met its prominent members, and from May 31 to June 14 of the same year he participated in the Theosophical Congress in Budapest. Numerous letters to friends testify to his enthusiasm for theosophy, in which he declared this teaching to be a grandiose world which he would like to introduce to his loved ones (Morgenstern 300-305). The relationship between Morgenstern and Steiner deepened in the following months and over time grew into a sincere friendship. Morgenstern's enthusiasm did not abate, so he wrote the draft for a letter to the Nobel Committee to suggest Steiner as a potential candidate for the prestigious award, believing that he deserved it as a scientist, poet and freedom fighter (Steiner 1931:18). Although Morgenstern's health deteriorated significantly in the course of 1913, he remained in close contact with his friend Steiner until his death on March 31, 1914. As a sign of deep devotion, his urn was turned over to Steiner, and the two close friends were buried next to each other in the park of the Goetheanum anthroposophical center in Dornach, Switzerland. Hermann Hesse's attitude towards the Austrian philosopher and his teachings is evidenced, among other things, by his letters to the psychoanalyst and later close friend Dr. Josef Bernhard Lang, who himself knew Steiner personally. Hesse, who was familiar with Eastern philosophy and esotericism, primarily perceived Steiner as an educator and spiritual teacher with whose views he immediately identified. In a letter dated January 21, 1918, he claims: Much about him coincides very closely with the ideas about the soul and personality that I have been developing in recent years (Vogele 72). However, the initial enthusiasm faded with time, but despite persistent denials of the influence of anthroposophy and growing criticism of Steiner, whom he resented for his excessive ambition, fanaticism and building of a cult of personality, Hesse maintained his ties with anthroposophical circles for many years, justifying this by the existence of good friends within them. Although he denied the influence of anthroposophy on his own work, it seems that Hesse indirectly paid tribute to Steiner and many years later in his last novel The Glass Bead Game, on which he began to work in 1932. In the fictional country of Castalia, a pedagogical province, where the intellectual elite lives far away from everyday life, the glass bead game is taught, a metaphorical representation of the universal fusion of science and art, in which all human knowledge and creativity are sublimated. In the search of deeper knowledge, the main protagonist Josef Knecht opposes the previous materialist doctrinal teachings, convinced that the deepest knowledge is embodied in the glass bead game, which forms the basis of man's divine nature and true spirituality. Although the introductory pages of Hesse's work refer to Nicholas of Cusa (1401-1464), he claims that his enjoyment of applying the figures and axioms of Euclid's geometry to theological-philosophical notions as allegories [...] points to our play of glass beads (Hesse 12), there is a noticeable connection with Steiner's anthroposophical teaching, for which he himself claimed that its foundations were based on the laws of geometry. In other works as well, such as Siddhartha and Narcissus and Chrysostom, Hesse, like Steiner, describes a man in constant search of truth, while in the early novel Beneath the Wheel he presents the tragic fate of an individual exposed before due time to excessive expectations and pressures of intellectual maturation, due to which he starts to doubt the ideals imposed upon him. Describing the suffering of the gifted Hans Giebenrath, Hesse strongly condemns the education system which was in place at the time, and which focused exclusively on the accumulation of knowledge, neglecting the personality and individual development of the individual. The criticism presented in this early work is in complete harmony with Steiner's concept of Waldorf pedagogy. How Hesse's contemporary Franz Kafka became acquainted with Rudolf Steiner's teachings has not been clarified to this day. It is very likely that his close friends Max Brod (1884-1968) and Felix Weltsch (1884-1964), who showed an interest in spirituality and occult teachings, drew his attention to this thinker. In addition to possessing three of Steiner's works, Kafka also attended his lectures in Prague in 1911, after which he asked to meet Steiner in person (cf. Kafka 1984 47). At a meeting held at the Victoria Hotel in Prague, the young writer confided his intimate thoughts and doubts to Steiner, about which he wrote exhaustively in a diary entry dated March 28, 1911. Torn between a job in an insurance company that he had accepted for financial reasons at his father's request and a desire to devote himself exclusively to writing, the 28-year-old Kafka hoped that Theosophy would provide him with answers to life's dilemmas and give him the necessary impetus to oppose his family and finally opt to become a literary author. At the same time, he was afraid that literature would bring additional unrest and insecurity into his life, so he expected Steiner to encourage him and disperse the fear. Steiner nevertheless remained reserved, after having listened to Kafka carefully, denying him the answer he had been hoping for and leaving it to him to make his own decision regarding Theosophy (Kafka 1984 50-51). Aware of his character and state of mind, of being torn and indecisive, but also of those special moments of creative enthusiasm, Kafka had been hoping that Steiner's teaching would serve him not only as an alternative way of solving life's dilemmas and establishing mental balance, but also as a source of inspiration. It also follows from the same diary entry that Kafka had more likely realized the connection between anthroposophy and art earlier, from Steiner's works (Kafka 1984 50). Steiner argued that clairvoyance, by which he meant a state of expanded perception, combined within itself imagination, inspiration and intuition and was therefore closely related not only to the hidden aspects of human existence, but also to artistic creation and aesthetic experience. According to Steiner, the real source which the artist draws upon while creating is the same one from which a man of expanded consciousness, an observer of spiritual worlds, extracts his experiences. As the issue at hand is a supersensible sphere hidden below the threshold of consciousness, he believed that theosophy and anthroposophy explained the ways of its cognition and the ways of its sanctification (Steiner, 1918 5). It is very likely that Kafka did not delve deeper into the study of theosophy. However, some later diary entries indicate the possibility of him not having completely given it up in the years that followed. Kafka was confronted with anthroposophy once again in the last days of his life. When he became seriously ill with tuberculosis in the spring of 1924 and was staying in a sanatorium near Vienna accompanied by Dora Diamant, he personally insisted that the twenty-seven-year-old physician and anthroposopher Norbert Glas (1897-1986) join the team of physicians that were taking care of him. In his last letter to his parents, Kafka described Glas as a doctor who came to see him three times a week and a man in whom he placed unlimited trust (Cermak; Svatos 80-83). However, his health had deteriorated so much that neither this new hope nor a change in therapy could be of to help him. He died on June 3, 1924. Adored and disputed at the same time, the controversial Rudolf Steiner was certainly one of the more intriguing personalities of his time, and his teachings irresistibly attracted many contemporaries. Why they stopped following him after a while or even openly criticized him remains unclear. It can be assumed that they were primarily repelled by his overly eccentric appearance, as evidenced by Kafka's diary entry, as well as certain statements made by Hermann Hesse. However, no matter how much they publicly spoke out against him, it seems that they still adhered to certain views of his and never completely renounced his teachings. Although many friends warned him that his reputation would be compromised by his acceptance of theosophy, which itself was discredited due to its closeness to Eastern scholasticism, occultism and spiritism, Steiner did not want to deviate from his views, but in time increasingly insisted on the otherworldly. Despite all this, Steiner's influence on his contemporaries as well as on later generations is by no means negligible and seems to be insufficiently researched even today.",0,0,Arts & Humanities - Other Topics

We find a strong relationship between what happens inside the labor market (worker's performance) and what happens outside the labor market (long-term investment). Contrary to the theoretical predictions with selfish preferences, we find that the mere presence of long-term projects acts as an effort-enforcement device; this effect seems to be driven by an increase in long-term employment relationships. In the other direction, long-term labor relationships seem to provide a safer environment for undertaking successful long-term projects. This article also considers three different types of experimental labor contracts. We find that performance-based dismissal barriers, whereby firms are required to retain workers if they have satisfied the effort level required by firms, lead to more long-term employment relationships and higher overall productivity. As theory predicts, the presence of renewable dismissal barriers makes it likely that workers will provide the desired effort level. Firms appear to correctly anticipate this, leading to greater social efficiency. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.",3,3,Business & Economics

The results showed that P-8 provided similar benefits in weight gain, feed intake and feed efficiency as antibiotics did. Importantly, P-8 activated protective immune responses of the broilers while antibiotics lacked this effect. P-8 induced higher fecal secretory IgA (sIgA) levels on day 42 (P <= 0.027) and IgA(+) lymphocytes in the jejunum and Peyer's patches (PP) (P < 0.001) compared to antibiotic treatment. Antibiotics reduced the IgA(+) lymphocytes in jejunum and PP on day 42 compared to the control. P-8 increased CD3(+) T cells in the small intestinal tissues in most test situations whereas antibiotics had fewer CD3(+) cells in PP and cecal tonsil compared with the control broilers at the end of the trial. In addition, P-8 increased CD4(+) T cells significantly in the intestinal tissues compared to both antibiotics and the control (P < 0.0052). Both Th1 and Th2 cytokine expression were enhanced by P-8 on day 14, consistent with the clinical trial results showing probiotic benefits in diseases. Antibiotics up- and down-regulated interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4 and IL-10 transcripts in an age-dependent manner, and showed anti-inflammatory potential. These data indicate that P-8 may provide protective immune response to broilers while maintaining similar growth performance and may be a potential alternative to antibiotics supplemented in chicken feeds.

The quantum efficiencies (molecules produced/incident photons) for the Au/rutile and Au/anatase systems for the selective oxidation of cinnamyl alcohol to cinnamaldehyde were calculated to be 1.4 X 10(-3) at lambda = 585 +/- 15 nm and 0.33 X 10(-3) at lambda = 555 +/- 15 nm, respectively. This superiority of rutile over anatase as the support of Au nanoparticle (NP) plasmon photocatalyst is also confirmed in the heterosupramolecular system consisting of Au/TiO2 and a cationic surfactant. In the system using Au/rutile, a quantum efficiency of 6.8 x 10(-3) at lambda = 585 +/- 15 nm has been achieved for the cinnamyl alcohol oxidation. Also, the plot of the visible-light activity versus Au particle size (d) for the Au/rutile system shows a volcano-shaped curve with a maximum at d approximate to 5 nm, while the activity of the Au/anatase system weakly depends on d. Photoelectrochemical measurements indicate that the Au/rutile system favors the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) induced interfacial electron transfer from Au to TiO2, Further, intrinsic Fano analysis for the absorption spectra of Au/TiO2 suggests that the elongation of the LSPR lifetime with the Au NP loading on rutile is primarily responsible for the enhancement of the alcohol oxidation. We concluded that the optimum d value is determined by the factors of the LSPR absorption intensity, the interfacial electron transfer efficiency, and the surface area.",125,127,Chemistry; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Materials Science

Because this relationship can influence medical research and practice, reporting disclosures are necessary to reveal any potential bias and inform consumers. The Sunshine Act was created to develop a new reporting system of these financial relationships called the Open Payments database. Currently all disclosures submitted with research to scientific meetings are at the discretion of the physician. We hypothesized that financial relationships between authors and the medical industry are underreported. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to describe concordance between physicians' financial disclosures listed in the abstract book from the 41st annual scientific meeting of the Society of Gynecologic Surgeons to physician payments reported to the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services Open Payments database for the same year. STUDY DESIGN: Authors and scientific committee members responsible for the content of the 41st annual scientific meeting of the Society of Gynecologic Surgeons were identified from the published abstract book; each abstract listed disclosures for each author. Abstract disclosures were compared with the transactions recorded on the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services Open Payments database for concordance. Two authors reviewed each nondisclosed Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services listing to determine the relatedness between the company listed on the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services and abstract content. RESULTS: Abstracts and disclosures of 335 physicians meeting inclusion criteria were reviewed. A total of 209 of 335 physicians (62%) had transactions reported in the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services, which totaled $ 1.99 million. Twenty-four of 335 physicians (7%) listed companies with their abstracts; 5 of those 24 physicians were concordant with the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services. The total amount of all nondisclosed transactions was $ 1.3 million. Transactions reported in the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services associated with a single physician ranged from $ 11.72 to $ 405,903.36. Of the 209 physicians with Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services transactions that were not disclosed, the majority (68%) had at least 1 company listed in the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services that was determined after review to be related to the subject of their abstract. CONCLUSION: Voluntary disclosure of financial relationships was poor, and the majority of unlisted disclosures in the abstract book were companies related to the scientific content of the abstract. Better transparency is needed by physicians responsible for the content presented at gynecological scientific meetings.",34,35,Obstetrics & Gynecology

When the ethical values of the employee are considerably higher than those of the organisation the potential for catastrophic results is enormous. In recent years several high profile cases have exposed organisations with ethical weaknesses. Academic medical institutions have exhibited such weaknesses and when exposed their employees have almost invariably been vindicated by objective inquiry. The mechanisms that work to produce such low ethical standards in what should be exemplary organisations are well documented and have been highlighted recently. The contribution of elements of medical training in eroding ethical standards of medical students have also been emphasised recently and strategies proposed to reduce or reverse this process. The ability to rapidly change the ethical and professional culture of graduate medical trainees may help to deal with some of the perceived problems of declining ethical standards in academic medicine.,33,33,Social Sciences - Other Topics; Medical Ethics; Social Issues; Biomedical Social Sciences

This study aimed at comparing antinociceptive and hyperthermic responses between two groups of mu-opioid receptor agonists: fentanyl (4-anilinopiperidine-type) and morphine (phenanthrene-type) derivatives in rats. Analgesic activity was assessed by tail immersion test and the body temperature by insertion of a thermometer probe into the colon. Fentanyl (F), (+/-)-cis-3-methyl fentanyl (CM), (+/-)-cis-3-carbomethoxy fentanyl (C), (+/-)trans-3-carbomethoxy fentanyl (T) and (+/-)-cis-3 butyl fentanyl (B) produced dose-dependent increase in antinociception and hyperthermia.

In the present study, we found that a 5-hydroxyoxindole derivative (5-HI) significantly inhibited LPS-induced inflammatory effects in the murine macrophage cell line, RAW264.7. 5-HI induced the expression of the transcription factor, Nrf2, which is typically ubiquitinated by Keap1, an adaptor component of the ubiquitin E3 ligase complex, resulting in its proteasomal degradation. By utilizing Keap1 -/- MEFs reconstituted with Keap1 mutants harboring substitutions in their major cysteine residues, we clarified the importance of Cys151 in Keap1 as a sensor for 5-HI in the induction of Nrf2 expression. Furthermore, 5-HI induced the activation of the MKK3/6-p38 pathway, which is required for the transcriptional activation of Nrf2. The knockdown of Nrf2 enhanced the LPS-induced expression of inflammatory mediators, including iNOS, NO, and CCL2, and effectively repressed the inhibitory effects of 5 HI on their expression. Although 5-HI and antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) both reduced LPS-induced ROS generation, the treatment with NAC did not affect the LPS-induced expression of inflammatory mediators, suggesting that the anti-inflammatory activity of 5-HI mediated by Nrf2 is independent of redox control. Furthermore, when injected into mice with 5-HI, the expression of Nrf2 was significantly increased, and the LPS-induced mRNA expression of CXCL1, CCL2, TNF alpha, and IL-6 were remarkably inhibited in the kidneys, liver, and lungs, and the production of these cytokines in serum was effectively reduced. Collectively, these results suggest that 5-HI has potential in the treatment of inflammatory diseases through the activation of Nrf2.",6,7,Pharmacology & Pharmacy

Our results provide little support for the hypothesis of buyers' rational economic behavior: the likelihood of feedback barely increases as we increase feedback rebate values; also, the speed of feedback, bid levels, and the number of bids are all insensitive to rebate values. By contrast, we find evidence consistent with reciprocal buyer behavior. Lower transaction quality leads to a higher probability of negative feedback as well as a speeding up of such negative feedback. However, when transaction quality is low (as measured by slow shipping), offering a rebate significantly decreases the likelihood of negative feedback. All in all, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that buyers reciprocate the sellers' good deeds (feedback rebate, high transaction quality) with more frequent and more favorable feedback.

Three iso-lipidic (ca 6.56%) diets were formulated with elevated corn starch levels at the cost of protein provision, being designated as diets P40S5 (40.4% protein and 4.62% starch), P30S25 (30.4% protein and 24.2% starch) and P20S50 (19.9% protein and 48.6% starch). Tilapia juveniles (initial mean body weight, 32.0 g/fish) were assigned to 12 rectangular tanks (250 L each) with 20 fish per tank and fed the experimental diets to apparent satiation for 8 weeks. The results showed that either excess (40%) or insufficient (20%) amount of dietary protein impaired the growth of tilapia. Excess dietary protein led to unsatisfactory protein catabolism (lower protein efficiency ratio and protein productive value, and higher mRNA levels of hepatic glutamic-pyruvic transaminase 1 and glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase paralogs), while insufficient amount of protein resulted in lower whole-body protein percentage. An increase in dietary starch from 5% or 25% to 50% was associated with enhanced lipid and glycogen storages in the liver of tilapia. Consistently, dietary starch reception up to 50% upregulated the expression of hepatic representative genes involved with glycolysis (glucokinase and phosphofructokinase muscle type a) and lipogenesis (acetyl-CoA carboxylase alpha and fatty acid synthase) while downregulated the expression of the gluconeogenic glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit paralogs. TUNEL staining suggested that stronger apoptosis signal was recorded at the bile duct epithelium of the P20S50 fish. Concomitantly, plasma bile acid level nearly doubled, and an incidence (50%) of 'green liver' was observed in this treatment as compared with the P40S5 and P30S25 fish, indicating that bile acid metabolism disorder might be induced. Though plasma glucose (4.66-5.11 mmol/L) was not responsive to different treatments, advanced glycation end-products accumulated in the blood of the P20S50 fish, suggesting that 50% starch reception was probably associated with the progression of diabetes-associated pathologies. The overall results in this study suggested that tilapia might possess capability to tolerate dietary corn starch level up to 50% in a short-term exposure, whereas a long-term exposure might induce detrimental effects on liver functions.",5,5,Fisheries

Transient phenomena occurs due to sudden changes in the fluid's propagation in pipelines system caused by rapid pressure and flow fluctuation due to events such as closing and opening valves rapidly or through pump failure. In this paper, the feasibility of the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) method/technique in analysing the pressure transient signals in presented and discussed. HHT is a way to decompose a signal into intrinsic mode functions (IMF). However, the advantage of HHT is its difficulty in selecting the suitable IMF for the next data post-processing method which is Hilbert Transform (HT). This paper reveals that utilizing the application of an integrated kurtosis-based algorithm for a z-filter technique (I-Kaz) to kurtosis ratio (I-Kaz-Kurtosis) allows/contributes to/leads to automatic selection of the IMF that should be used. This technique is demonstrated on a 57.90-meter medium high-density polyethylene (MDPE) pipe installed with a single artificial leak. The analysis results using the I-Kaz-kurtosis ratio revealed/confirmed that the method can be used as an automatic selection of the IMF although the noise level ratio of the signal is low. Therefore, the I-Kaz-kurtosis ratio method is recommended as a means to implement an automatic selection technique of the IMF for HHT analysis.",3,3,Engineering; Materials Science

We investigated the effects of compounds isolated from Psoralea corylifolia on oxidative stress-induced cell death in vitro and in vivo. Transformed retinal ganglion cells (RGC-5) were treated with L-buthione-(S,R)-sulfoximine (BSO) and glutamate in the presence or with pre-treatment with compound 6, bakuchiol isolated from P. corylifolia. We observed reduced cell death in cells pre-treated with bakuchiol. Moreover, bakuchiol inhibited the oxidative stress-induced decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP, Delta Psi m). Furthermore, while intracellular Ca2+ was high in RGC-5 cells after exposure to oxidative stress, bakuchiol reduced these levels. In an in vivo study, in which rat retinal damage was induced by intravitreal injection of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), bakuchiol markedly reduced translocation of AIF and release of cytochrome c, and inhibited up-regulation of cleaved caspase-3, cleaved caspase-9, and cleaved PARP. The survival rate of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) 7 days after optic nerve crush (ONC) in mice was significantly decreased; however, bakuchiol attenuated the loss of RGCs. Moreover, bakuchiol attenuated ONC-induced up-regulation of apoptotic proteins, including cleaved PARP, cleaved caspase-3, and cleaved caspase-9. Bakuchiol also significantly inhibited translocation of mitochondrial AIF into the nuclear fraction and release of mitochondrial cytochrome c into the cytosol. These results demonstrate that bakuchiol isolated from P. corylifolia has protective effects against oxidative stress-induced retinal damage, and may be considered as an agent for treating or preventing retinal degeneration.

Akt phosphorylation mediates a neuroprotective effect against ischemic injury. Recently, a protein-tyrosine phosphatase-1B (PTP1B) inhibitor (KY-226) was developed to elicit anti-diabetic and anti-obesity effects via enhancement of insulin signaling. Previously, we reported that the nonselective PTP1B inhibitor, sodium orthovanadate, rescued neurons from delayed neuronal death during brain ischemia. In this study, we confirmed the ameliorative effects of KY-226 on ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury using a murine model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). ICR mice were subjected to MCAO for 2 h followed by reperfusion. Although KY-226 permeability was poor through the blood brain barrier (BBB) of normal mice, it could penetrate through the BBB of mice after I/R insult. Intraperitoneal KY-226 administration elicited dose-dependent reductions in infarcted brain areas and improved neurological deficits. The neuroprotective effects of KY-266 were obtained when administered within 0.5 h after reperfusion. KY-226 (10 mg/kg) also restored reduced Akt phosphorylation and eNOS phosphorylation (Ser-1177) levels following I/R insult. Moreover, 10 mg/kg of KY-226 improved I/R-induced decreased extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation. Furthermore, KY-226 attenuated the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in mouse cortex. These results suggest that KY-226 may act as a novel therapeutic candidate for ischemic stroke.

The aim of this study was to determine the effect and mechanism of action of local (intraplantar) administration of magnesium sulfate (MS) on the paw withdrawal threshold (PWT) to mechanical stimuli. The PWT was evaluated by the electronic von Frey test in male Wistar rats. Tested drugs were either co-administered intraplantarly (i.pl.) with MS or given into the contralateral paw to exclude systemic effects. MS at doses of 0.5, 1.5, 3 and 62 mg/paw (i.pl.) induced a statistically significant (as compared to 0.9% NaCl) and dose-dependent mechanical hyperalgesia. Only isotonic MS (250 mmol/l or 6.2% or 62 mg/paw) induced mechanical hyperalgesia that lasted at least six hours. Isotonic MS-induced mechanical hyperalgesia was reduced in a dose-dependent manner by co-injection of camphor, a non-selective TRPA1 antagonist (0.3, 1 and 2.5 mu g/paw), MK-801, a NMDA receptor antagonist (0.001, 0.025 and 0.1 mu g/paw), L-NAME, a non-selective nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor (20, 50 and 100 mu g/paw), ARL 17477, a selective neuronal NOS inhibitor (5.7 and 17 mu g/paw), SMT, a selective inducible NOS inhibitor (1 and 2.78 mu g/paw), and methylene blue, a guanylate cyclase inhibitor (5, 20 and 125 mu g/paw).

As informal payments are more likely to occur in health systems characterized by a high out-of-pocket payment rate, it is argued that formalized prepaid health insurance programs may help to curb such practice. Methods Using panel data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Survey, this study examined the association between changes in health insurance coverage on patient's behavior proxied with informal payments. Results The statistical results reveal that health insurance status in fact increases the probability of patients making informal payments to physicians. However, this association varies among population groups and insurance programs, particularly between social health insurance and private health insurance status. Conclusions In a health system characterized by unequal allocation of medical resources, the dual pursuit of cost saving and quality of care may drive patients to make informal payments for personal gains. This study argues that health policy interventions aimed at curbing informal payments must be based on a thorough understanding of their complex socioeconomic causes and attack the perverse incentives in a coherent and bona fide manner.",3,3,Health Care Sciences & Services

In recent years, a variety of feedback strategies have been proposed. Despite the fact that these strategies have been proved to enhance the traffic efficiency, we find that the road capacity has not been saturated and there is still plenty of room for improvement. Based on the analytic approximations, we found the reason why corresponding angle feedback strategy is superior to weighted congestion coefficient feedback strategy. Given that the sharp decay of the weighted coefficient is the key point, we proposed an efficient feedback strategy called the exponential function feedback strategy (EFFS). We applied it to both the symmetrical two-route model with two exits and that with a single exit. The simulation results indicate that, compared with other strategies, EFFS has decided numerical advantages in average flow, a physical quantity used for depicting the road capacity. Even more importantly, EFFS stands out for its convenient application as well as its fitness for modeling the rugged roads. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The treatment with irbesartan significantly lowered systolic blood pressure with a concomitant decrease in body weight in KKAy mice. In addition, irbesartan significantly decreased the adipose leptin mRNA expression and tended to decrease IL-6 mRNA expression in the adipose tissue of KKAy mice. Furthermore irbesartan preserved the adipose gene expression of AT1R-associated protein (ATRAP), an endogenous inhibitory molecule of tissue AT1R signaling, with a concomitant tendency of up-regulation of adipose tissue ATRAP/AT1R ratio. Collectively, these results suggest that the irbesartan-induced beneficial suppressive effect on the leptin-IL-6 axis in the adipose tissue in KKAy mice is partly mediated by a trend of up-regulation of the adipose ATRAP/AT1R ratio as one of pleiotropic effects of irbesartan.",10,11,General & Internal Medicine

The values were compared as noted by respondents (1st-year students and university entrants) among different generations of Russians: their own world (the world of children), the world of parents and the world of grandparents. All the three generations are dominated by being oriented towards hard work, study, mutual assistance both within the global environment and within a small society, that is, within family. These positions are represented by the phraseological layers of the language, which indicates their presence in the Russian national value worldview. In the world of parents and in that of children, the emergence of new groups of values absent in the world of grandparents is recorded: orientation towards consumer values, perceived from advertising in the media, and at the same time the extinction of the value of serving the homeland. A new value stands out in the world of children - a humorous approach to life problems, which can be considered global because it contains quotations from world literature and borrowed phraseological units. This value is distinguished by an optimistic view of the world and the role of man in it, which is characteristic of youth. The research results allow asserting that Generation Z is ready to be creative and is oriented towards technology.

At first, pulse response and peak parking experiments were conducted to measure some parameters concerning the column geometry, adsorption equilibrium, and mass-transfer kinetics. Then, the first absolute moment (mu(1)) and second central moment (mu(2)') of the elution peaks were analyzed by the moment equations, which were developed by assuming that the reaction kinetics between the solute molecules and the functional ligands can be represented by the Langmuir-type rate equation. Finally, the flow-rate dependence of HETP calculated from mu(1) and mu(2)' was analyzed by using the values of the parameters to determine the association and dissociation rate constants of the intermolecular interaction.

Here we show that a subset of short-chain leaf volatiles with an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl bond in their structure (reactive short-chain leaf volatiles, RSLVs) like (E)-2-hexenal and (E)-2-butenal can act as signal chemicals that strongly induce the gene expression of abiotic-related transcription factors, such as heat stress-related transcription factors (HSFA2, MBF1c) and other abiotic stress-related transcription factors (DREB2A, ZATs). RSLV-induced expression of HSFA2 and MBF1c was eliminated in HSFA1s-, known as heat stress response master regulators, knockout mutant, whereas those of DREB2A and ZATs were not, suggesting that the RSLV signaling pathway is composed of HSFA1-dependent and -independent pathways. RSLV treatment induced production of chaperon proteins, and the RSLV-treated Arabidopsis thus demonstrated enhanced abiotic stress tolerance. Because oxidative stress treatment enhanced RSLV production, we concluded that commonly found RSLVs produced by environmental stresses are powerful inducer of abiotic stress-related gene expression as oxidative stress signals.",64,66,Science & Technology - Other Topics

UV-induced skin damage is mediated by growth factors and proinflammatory cytokines such as granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). In a previous study, we found that the saponin of Korean Red Ginseng (SKRG) decreased the expression of GM-CSF in UVB-irradiated SP-1 keratinocytes. In this study, we attempted to find the inhibitory mechanism of SKRG on UVB-induced GM-CSF expression in SP-1 keratinocytes. Methods: We investigated the inhibitory mechanism of SKRG and ginsenosides from Panax ginseng on UVB-induced GM-CSF expression in SP-1 keratinocytes. Results: Treatment with SKRG decreased the expression of GM-CSF mRNA and protein induced by irradiation of UVB in SP-1 keratinocytes. The phosphorylation of ERK was induced by UVB at 10 min, and decreased with SKRG treatment in SP-1 keratinocytes. In addition, treatment with SKRG inhibited the UVB-induced phosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which is known to be an upstream signal of ERK. From these results, we found that the inhibition of GM-CSF expression by SKRG was derived from the decreased phosphorylation of EGFR. To identify the specific compound composing SKRG, we tested fifteen kinds of ginsenosides. Among these compounds, ginsenoside-Rh3 decreased the expression of GM-CSF protein and mRNA in SP-1 keratinocytes. Conclusion: Taken together, we found that treatment with SKRG decreased the phosphorylation of EGFR and ERK in UVB-irradiated SP-1 keratinocytes and subsequently inhibited the expression of GM-CSF. Furthermore, we identified ginsenoside-Rh3 as the active saponin in Korean Red Ginseng. Copyright (C) 2015, The Korean Society of Ginseng, Published by Elsevier.

Our aim was to examine whether NE-induced pulmonary endothelial injury is associated with endotoxemia. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 20 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally into 9- to 12-week-old granulocyte colony-stimulating factor knockout (G-CSFKO) mice, which harbor few neutrophils, and littermate control mice; in a second assay, mice were injected with the NE-inhibitor sivelestat (0.2 mg/kg) at 3, 6, 9, and 12 hours after LPS administration. Subsequently, vascular endothelial injury was evaluated through ultrastructural analysis. At 48 hours after LPS injection, survival rate was more than threefold higher among G-CSFKO than control mice, and degradation of both thrombomodulin and syndecan-1 was markedly attenuated in G-CSFKO compared with control mice. Ultrastructural analysis revealed attenuated vascular endothelial injury and clear preservation of the endothelial glycocalyx in G-CSFKO mice. Moreover, after LPS exposure, survival rate was approximately ninefold higher among sivelestat-injected mice than control mice, and sivelestat treatment potently preserved vascular endothelial structures and the endothelial glycocalyx.

When a third-party site has completed the registration on an AS, a user can authorize the third-party site by the AS to access the protected resource on a resource server. After the user has completed the authorization, the AS redirects the user to a designated site based on the registration information. However, if an AS was attacked by an attacker after completed the register, the attacker may modify or forge registration information, then a user may be redirected to a malicious site. To solve the problem above, we propose a verified secure protocol model of OAuth dynamic client registration (VSPM_ODCR) which can be used to ensure the security of the registration information. Our approach is to separate the registration function from the AS by introducing a security registry center. All the sensitive parameters about the registration process will be protected by the security registry center. The protected registration information is designed to be verifiable. That is, at the time of authorization, the AS provides the registration information of the third-party site to be verified by the user. As a result, the AS attacked by an attacker can not complete the authorization function without the help of the security registration center. To prove the reliability of the model, we give an abstract formal description of the model, and a formal definition of the security properties needed to be satisfied.

However, these studies do not provide enough information about if, when, how and why their attitudes and behaviors change over time. Methods and Findings: A qualitative study using semi-structured face-to-face individual interviews was conducted on 9 Japanese physicians who attended a symposium on conflicts of interest held in Tokyo. Interviews were designed to explore chronological changes in individual physicians' attitude and behavior concerning relationships with pharmaceutical representatives and factors affecting such changes. Their early interaction with pharmaceutical representatives was passive as physicians were not explicitly aware of the meaning of such interaction. They began to think on their own about how to interact with pharmaceutical representatives as they progressed in their careers. Their attitude toward pharmaceutical representatives changed over time. Factors affecting attitudinal change included work environment (local regulations and job position), role models, views of patients and the public, acquisition of skills in information seeking and evidence-based medicine, and learning about the concepts of professionalism and conflict of interest. However, the change in attitude was not necessarily followed by behavioral change, apparently due to rationalization and conformity to social norms. Conclusions: Physicians' attitudes toward relationships with pharmaceutical representatives changed over time and factors affecting such changes were various. Paying attention to these factors and creating new social norms may be both necessary to produce change in behavior consistent with change in attitude.",8,8,Science & Technology - Other Topics

For a population ofM. ledain South India, we observed male-male and male-female interactions in captivity, measured mating duration and spermatophore mass, and also determined the degree of polyandry in the wild. We found that mating behavior takes place for short periods of time around dawn and dusk. Our observations corroborate that males compete in aerial combats (twirling) and interfere with mating pairs. In the morning, they may use shivering to warm up. Females can twirl with males and refuse mating by pointing their abdomens upwards or by flying away. Males court females by fluttering their wings while perched behind females, and then initiate copulation by curling their abdomens ca. 180 degrees sideways to make genital contact. While in the morning, matings lasted on average one hour and twenty-three minutes and never exceeded three hours, in the evening, matings could be of similar duration, but 42% of butterflies only separated when dawn was approaching. However, such long nocturnal matings did not result in heavier spermatophores. The first spermatophore of a male tended to be larger than subsequent spermatophores. Together with previous studies on this species, our findings suggest that males compete mainly through territorial defense (as reported before), courtship performance, and interference, and to a lesser extent by providing spermatophores, while females exert some control over the mating system by the timing of their receptivity and mate choice.",0,0,Entomology

The adsorption induces a strong absorption in the whole visible region, of which intensity increases with an increase in the adsorption amount. Photoelectrochemical experiments and molecular orbital calculations indicate that the absorption stems from the charge-transfer (CT) transition from the HOMO of catechol to the conduction band of TiO2.

However, it is associated with some challenges such as compositional bias. In this study, to overcome these difficulties, we devised a 'pattern enrichment analysis.' In this method, two samples (one obtained by affinity selection, the other simply amplified without selection) are prepared, and the two sequence datasets read on next-generation sequencer are compared to find the three-residue pattern most enriched in the selected sample. This allows us to compare two sequence datasets with high coverage and facilitates the identification of peptide sequences and the key residues for binding. We also demonstrated that this approach in the combination with structured peptide libraries allowed spatial mapping of the enriched sequence patterns. Here, we prepared a phage library displaying chemically stapled helical peptides with the X1C2X3X4X5X6X7X8C9X10 sequence, where X is any amino acid. To validate our method, we performed screening against the HDM2 protein. The results showed that the hydrophobic residues (Phe, Tyr, Trp and Leu) that are key to interactions with HDM2 were clearly identified by the pattern enrichment analysis.

The internal consistency of the subscales of PASMS, which consisted of 27 items, varied between 0.89 and 0.91. The internal consistency for the whole scale was found to be 0.95. The correlations among PASMS and other anxiety-related measures were significant and in the expected direction, indicating that the scale has convergent validity. The construct validity of the scale was assessed in Study 2 by confirmatory factor analysis. After several revisions, the final tested model achieved acceptable fits. In Study 3, the 14-day test-retest reliability of the final 24-item version of PASMS was tested and found to be extremely high (0.95). In all three studies, the whole scale and subscale scores of females were significantly higher than for males.",8,9,General & Internal Medicine; Music

The importance, deficiency, and toxic effects of Se mainly depend on its quantity and chemical nature. It has been observed that the inorganic versions of Se are more hazardous than the organic versions. This review is mainly focused on the application of different extraction methods used for Se extraction and determination such as microextraction, solid-phase extraction (SPE), and their modified modes in the last 12 years. The use of different dispersive medium (magnetic field, ultrasonic radiation, and vortex agitator) to enhance Se separation is also part of this review. The usage of environmentally friendly solvents such as supramolecular solvents, hydrophobic deep eutectic solvents (DESs), and ionic liquids (ILs) are also the focus of attention in this review. This review is also emphasized the application of advanced microextraction methods, particularly liquid-phase microextraction (LPME). The most recent advances in LPME extraction techniques for Se in various environmental samples, as well as their prospects, are reviewed. Additionally, a summary of cheap, simple, and accurate techniques that have not yet been used to determine small amounts of Se has been provided.",6,6,Chemistry

Nanosilica was characterized by X-ray diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Adsorption of PDADMAC onto SiO2 increased with increasing pH because the negative charge of SiO2 is higher at high pH. Adsorption isotherms of PDADMAC onto silica at different KCl concentrations were fitted well by a two-step adsorption model. Adsorption mechanisms of PDADMAC onto SiO2 are discussed on the basis of surface charge change, evaluation by potential, surface modification by FTIR measurements, and the adsorption isotherm. The application of PDADMAC adsorption onto SiO2 to remove amoxicillin antibiotic (AMX) was also studied. Experimental conditions such as contact time, pH, and adsorbent dosage for removal of AMX using SiO2 modified with PDADMAC were systematically optimized and found to be 180 min, pH 10, and 10 mg/mL, respectively. The removal efficiency of AMX using PDADMAC-modified SiO2 increased significantly from 19.1% to 92.3% under optimum adsorptive conditions. We indicate that PDADMAC-modified SiO2 rice husk is a novel adsorbent for removal of antibiotics from aqueous solution.",60,60,Polymer Science

Dexamethasone, a synthetic corticosteroid, induced apoptosis of naive and memory CD8(+) T cells but virus-specific effector cells were spared. CD8(+) T cell susceptibility was directly correlated with the expression of nr3c1. Both alpha-(HSV1) and gamma-(MHV68) herpesvirus infection expanded CD8(+) T cells down regulated nr3c1 indicating corticosteroid-mediated effects were not limited to one pathogen or the specific clonotype. Dexamethasone compromised anti-viral immunity to subsequent infections, likely through reductions in the naive cell pool. Dexamethasone augmented the function and inflammatory tissue homing potential of effector cells via upregulation of CXCR3. Accordingly, an antibody neutralization of CXCR3 diminished dexamethasone-induced migration of CD8(+) T cells to tissues resulting in increased virus burden. Our study therefore suggests that even a transient corticosteroid therapy influences both ongoing CD8(+) T cell responses as well as the size of the naive and memory repertoire.",9,10,Immunology

Molecular scale cobalt(III) oxide clusters are formed on the surface of highly active anatase TiO2 nanoparticles (Co2O3-TiO2) by the chemisorption-calcination cycle method. Co2O3-TiO2 exhibits very high visible-light activities for the degradation of 2-naphthol and formic acid used as model organic pollutants. Unprecedented thermocatalytic activity is concomitantly endowed on TiO2 by the surface modification. Prolonging reaction time in the Co2O3-TiO2 photo-and thermo-catalyzed reactions leads to the decomposition of 2-naphthol and formic acid to CO2. The essential action mechanisms of the Co2O3 clusters in the photocatalysis and thermocatalysis of Co2O3-TiO2 were discussed on the basis of spectroscopic and electrochemical data.,18,18,Chemistry; Physics

The effectiveness of a certain compensation strategy (e.g., repaying money, sharing loss, etc.) may vary as a function of the social norm/relationship. Previous studies have shown that two types of norms (or relationships), monetary/exchange and social/communal, differentially characterize people's appraisal of and response to social exchanges. In this study, we investigated how individual differences in preference for these norms affect individuals' perception of others' as well as the selection of their own reciprocal behaviors. In a two-phase experiment with interpersonal transgression, we asked the participant to perform a dot-estimation task with two partners who occasionally and unintentionally inflicted noise stimulation upon the participant (first phase). As compensation one partner gave money to the participant 80% of the time (the monetary partner) and the other bore the noise for the participant 80% of the time (the social partner). Results showed that the individuals' preference for compensation (repaying money versus bearing noise) affected their relationship (exchange versus communal) with the partners adopting different compensation strategies: participants tended to form communal relationships and felt closer to the partner whose compensation strategy matched their own preference. The participants could be differentiated into a social group, who tended to form communal relationship with the social partner, and a monetary group, who tended to form communal relationship with the monetary partner. In the second phase of the experiment, when the participants became transgressors and were asked to compensate for their transgression with money, the social group offered more compensation to the social partners than to the monetary partners, while the monetary group compensated less than the social group in general and showed no difference in their offers to the monetary and social partners. These findings demonstrate that the effectiveness of compensation varies as a function of individuals' preference for communal versus monetary norm and that monetary compensation alone does not heal all wounds.",3,5,Psychology

Yet, adjacent cells showed no sign of membrane damage and no increased caspase activity. The laserexposed cells eventually detached from the substrate after a delay of >54 min while adjacent cells remained intact. On the base of in vitro experiments, we applied the same approach to ablate targeted single cardiac cells of a live zebrafish heart.

Climate change is expected to further stress freshwater resources and widen the gap between the demand for and supply of water. As a legacy of the earlier planned economy, water resources management has been primarily supply-driven, which largely fails to account for the economic nature of water resources in relation to their natural characteristics. This paper presents a historical perspective on the water resources management policies and practices in China, and recommends demand management and pollution control as key measures for improving water resources management to adapt to climate change based on the current political, socio-economic and water resources conditions. The past and future impacts of climate change on water resources in China and the general adaptation strategies are also presented. How demand management through increasing water use efficiency, improving water rights and rights trade, and effective regulation enforcement, along with pollution control could improve China's water resources management are discussed in details. Ultimately, China should develop a sustainable water resources management strategy based on both supply- and demand-side management options to make the limited water supplies meet the demands of economic development, social well-being and the conservation of ecosystems in the context of global climate change.",52,54,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences

Ttyh1 immunoreactivity in vitro was frequently found in invaginations of dendritic spines; however, Ttyh1, seldom co-localized with synaptic markers in vivo. Silencing Ttyh1 expression with siRNA in hippocampal cultures resulted in alterations of MAP2 distribution along neurites causing it to appear in the form of chains of beads. Over-expression of Ttyh1 caused intense neuritogenesis and the formation of numerous filopodia-like protrusions. Similar protrusions were also produced in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells over-expressing Ttyh1. Using a biotin-streptavidin pull-down assay and mass spectrometry, we identified proteins that can form complexes with Ttyh1 in the brain. Ttyh1 binding proteins are often expressed in the endoplasmic reticulum or the Golgi apparatus or are localized at synapses.

However, not much is known about the appropriate strategies to be implemented during these processes, and little scientific inquiry has been conducted in this area. The aim of this study was to identify variables of swimming, ball handling and physical ability, as well as game intelligence, which could assist in the selection process of young water-polo players. Twenty-four players aged 14-15 years underwent a battery of tests three times during a 2-year period, before selection to the junior national team. The tests included: freestyle swim for 50, 100, 200 and 400 m, 100-m breast-stroke, 100-m 'butterfly' (with breast-stroke leg motion), 50-m dribbling, throwing at the goal, throw for distance in the water, vertical 'jump' from the water, and evaluation of game intelligence by two coaches. A comparison of those players eventually selected to the team and those not selected demonstrated that, 2 years before selection, selected players were already superior on most of the swim tasks (with the exception of breast-stroke and 50-m freestyle), as well as dribbling and game intelligence. This superiority was maintained throughout the 2 years. Two-way tabulation revealed that, based on baseline scores, the prediction for 67% of the players was in agreement with the final selection to the junior national team. We recommend that fewer swim events be used in the process of selecting young water-polo players, and that greater emphasis should be placed on evaluation of game intelligence.",100,109,Sport Sciences

Identification of host factors involved in cccDNA transcriptional regulation is expected to prove a new venue for HBV therapy. Recent evidence suggests the involvement of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in mediating the interaction of host factors with various viruses, however, lncRNAs that HBV targets and represses cccDNA transcription have not been fully elucidated. Here, the authors identified LINC01431 as a novel host restriction factor for HBV transcription. Mechanically, LINC01431 competitively bound with type I protein arginine methyltransferase (PRMT1) to block the HBx-mediated PRMT1 ubiquitination and degradation. Consequently, LINC01431 increased the occupancy of PRMT1 on cccDNA, leading to enhanced H4R3me2a modification and reduced acetylation of cccDNA-bound histones, thereby repressing cccDNA transcription. In turn, to facilitate viral replication, HBV transcriptionally repressed LINC01431 expression by HBx-mediated repression of transcription factor Zinc fingers and homeoboxes 2 (ZHX2). Collectively, the study demonstrates LINC01431 as a novel epigenetic regulator of cccDNA minichromosome and highlights a feedback loop of HBx-LINC01431-PRMT1 in HBV replication, which provides potential therapeutic targets for HBV treatment.",4,4,Chemistry; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Materials Science

These proteins have attracted clinical attention as a cause of malabsorption and as a target for diabetes drugs. Each SGLT isoform has strict selectivity for its monosaccharide substrate. Few studies have attempted to elucidate the structural basis of sugar selectivity by allowing generating SGLT mutants that bind substrates not normally transported or by reproducing the substrate specificity of other isoforms. In this study, we built a structural homology model for the substrate binding states of human SGLT1 (hSGLT1), which primarily transports glucose and galactose. We also performed electrophysiological analysis of hSGLT1 using various natural sugars and mutants. By mutating the K321 residue, which forms hydrophilic interactions in the sugar binding pocket, we induced mannose and allose transport. We also changed the glucose/galactose transport ratio, which reproduces the substrate specificity of the prokaryotic galactose transporter. By adding mutations one-by-one to the residues in the binding pocket, we were able to reproduce the substrate specificity of SGLT4, which transports fructose. This suggests that fructose, which exhibits various structures in equilibrium, binds to SGLT in a pyranose conformation. These results reveal one state of the structural basis that determines selective transport by SGLT. These findings will be useful for predicting the substrates of other glucose transporters and to design effective inhibitors.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

Commun., 2013, 49, 10224-10226). Reported herein are the synthesis, characterisation and evaluation of the biological activity of a new series of ruthenium(II) complexes of the type [(eta(6)-arene)Ru(N,N-L)Cl]PF6 (arene = p-cymene, benzene, 2-phenylethanol or indane, L = 4-anilinoquinazolines). These organometallic ruthenium complexes undergo fast hydrolysis in aqueous solution. Intriguingly, the ligation of (arene)Ru-II fragments with 4-anilinoquinazolines not only makes the target complexes excellent EGFR inhibitors, but also confers the complexes high affinity to bind to DNA minor grooves while maintaining their reactivity towards DNA bases, characterising them with dual-targeting properties. Molecular modelling studies reveal that the hydrolysis of these complexes is a favourable process which increases the affinity of the target complexes to bind to EGFR and DNA. In vitro biological activity assays show that most of this group of ruthenium complexes are selectively active inhibiting the EGF-stimulated growth of the HeLa cervical cancer cell line, and the most active complex [(eta(6)-arene)Ru(N,N-L13)Cl]PF6 (4, IC50 = 1.36 mu M, L13 = 4-(3'-chloro-4'-fluoroanilino)-6-(2-(2-aminoethyl)aminoethoxy)-7-methoxyquinazoline) is 29-fold more active than its analogue, [(eta(6)-arene)Ru(N,N-ethylenediamine)Cl]PF6, and 21-fold more active than gefitinib, a well-known EGFR inhibitor in use clinically.

One of the substances in P. attenuatum has been suggested to have anti-inflammatory effects. However, there is insufficient research about the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of action of P. attenuatum. The effects of P. attenuatum methanol extract (Pa-ME) on the production of inflammatory mediators nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E-2 (PGE(2)), the expression of proinflammatory genes, the translocation level of transcription factors, and intracellular signaling activities were investigated using macrophages. Pa-ME suppressed the production of NO and PGE(2) in lipopolysaccharide-(LPS-), pam3CSK4-, and poly(I:C)-stimulated RAW264.7 cells without displaying cytotoxicity. The mRNA expression levels of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) were decreased by Pa-ME. P-ME reduced the translocation of p50/NF-kappa B and AP-1 (c-Jun and c-Fos), as well as the activity of their upstream enzymes Src, Syk, and TAK1.

The phase structures of CeO2@SiO2 and CeO2 nanoparticles that were fabricated by a simple procedure were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, while their interfacial characterizations were performed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method, and zeta-potential measurements. The removal efficiency of the antibiotic amoxicillin (AMX) using CeO2@SiO2 nanoparticles was much greater than that using SiO2 and CeO2 materials in solutions of different pH values. The optimum conditions for AMX removal using CeO2@SiO2 including contact time and adsorbent dosage were 120 min and 5 mg/mL, respectively. The maximum AMX removal using CeO2@SiO2 reached 100% and the adsorption capacity was 12.5 mg/g. Adsorption isotherms of AMX onto CeO2@SiO2 were fitted by Langmuir, Freundlich, and two-step adsorption models, while the adsorption kinetics of AMX achieved a better fit by the pseudo-second-order model than the pseudo-first-order model. The electrostatic and nonelectrostatic interactions between the zwitterionic form of AMX and the positively charged CeO2@SiO2 surface were controlled by adsorption. The effects of different organics such as humic acid, ionic surfactants, and pharmaceutical substances on AMX removal using CeO2@SiO2 were also thoroughly investigated. The high AMX removal efficiencies of about 75% after four regenerations and about 70% from an actual water sample demonstrate that CeO2@SiO2-based rice husk is a hybrid nanomaterial for antibiotic removal from water environments.",39,39,Chemistry; Materials Science

KY-226 restores Akt (protein kinase B) phosphorylation and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) reduction in transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) damage. However, the mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects of KY-226 are unclear. To address this, the effects of KY-226 on blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction were examined in tMCAO mice. KY-226 (10 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered to ICR mice 30 min after 2 h of tMCAO. To assess Akt or ERK involvement, wortmannin (i.c.v.) or U0126 (i.v.), selective inhibitors of PI3K and ERK, respectively, were administered to mice 30 min before ischemia. BBB integrity was assessed by Evans blue leakage 24 h post-reperfusion. The levels of tight junction (TJ) proteins, ZO-1 and occludin, were measured by western blotting; ZO-1 mRNA level was measured by RT-PCR. Compared to vehicle, KY-226 treatment prevented BBB breakdown and reduction in TJ protein levels. KY-226 treatment restored ZO-1 mRNA levels post-reperfusion. Pre-administration of wortmannin or U0126 blocked the protective effects of KY-226 on ZO-1 protein and mRNA reduction in tMCAO mice. In bEnd.3 cells, lipopolysaccharide treatment reduced mRNA and protein levels of ZO-1, an effect rescued by KY-226 treatment. Further, KY-226 treatment restored phosphorylation of pAkt (T308) and its downstream target forkhead box protein O1 (FoxO1) (S256) in bEnd.3 cells. Collectively, we demonstrate that KY-226 protects BBB integrity by restoration of TJ proteins, an effect partly mediated by Akt/FoxO1 pathway activation. Thus, protection of BBB integrity likely underlies KY-226-induced neuroprotection in tMCAO mice. (C) 2018 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",19,19,Neurosciences & Neurology

To establish a distinctive drug delivery system directed against the tumor microenvironment features, we develop a newly engineered polymeric nanoplatform for efficient doxorubicin (DOX) delivery with reduced systemic toxicity and high antitumor efficiency. A thioketal cross-linker is used to improve the formulation's stability during circulation and to foster quick intracellular drug release in response to tumor's ROS potential.

In addition, this formulation shows significant improvement in the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution profiles with a 2.69-fold increase of tumor accumulation, while with largely reduced systemic toxicity in comparison with free DOX.

This mine trace is characterized by a linear-blotch type with a clear centric frass trail composed of closely and randomly dispersed pellets filling the mine width in the early stage. We found traces of a possible egg case and an exit slit from the leaf. These features are most consistent with those produced by members of Nepticulidae. Our record demonstrates for the first time the trophic association of Nepticulidae with Fagus in the Miocene and suggests the persistence of a long-term association between the insect family and the plant genus from the Miocene to the present. Other Nepticulidae leaf mines in the Miocene and leaf-mine fossils from the Geumgwangdong Formation are briefly reviewed.

It produces darkly pigmented resting structures known as microsclerotia, which are able to survive for up to 14 years in soil, and represent one of the defining characteristics of this species. The pigment produced in V. dahliae is dihydroxynaphthalene (DHN)-melanin, a form of melanin common among fungi and named so for the intermediary of this melanin biosynthetic pathway. In this study, we characterized the function of the V. dahliae Vayg1 gene, whose homologs were involved in melanin biosynthesis in Exophiala dermatitidis (Wayg1) and Aspergillus fumigatus (Aayg1), by deletion and complementation of the gene and co-incubating deletion mutant with wild-type strain. Results showed that melanin production and microsclerotial formation in deletion mutants are inhibited. The Vayg1 deletion mutant also exhibited reduced pathogenicity. These results showed that Vayg1 is necessary for melanin and microsclerotium production, and we may thus hypothesize that the Vayg1 product may catalyze two different precursors, one of which is essential for DHN melanin production and the other one is involved in a signal network for microsclerotial formation in V. dahliae.

Since there has been no study that takes the polymorphisms of Cx37 and connexin 40 (Cx40) into consideration at the same time, we investigated the association between AMI and the polymorphism gene of two gap junction proteins Cx 37 and Cx40 which are important in the electrical coupling between arterial myocytes. Methods: 200 patients with acute myocardial infarction (AM!) and 185 healthy controls were included in this study. Cx37 and Cx40 genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). Results: We identified that single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of Cx37 was significantly associated with AM! disease. Significant differences between cases and controls were observed for Cx37 genotype frequencies (p < 0.001, chi(2) = 16.528). The T allele of Cx37 had more frequency in the AMI group compared to the control group. (53.75% vs. 40%; p < 0.05). Subsequent analysis identified that, in contrast to the previous studies, there is a significant difference in women (p < 0.01) but not in men. We also found that the SNP of Cx40 was not significantly associated with AMI disease (p > 0.05). Our study showed that the -44A allele and -44AA genotype were not significantly different in the AMI and control groups (p > 0.05).

In this study, the clock gene homologues of Clock (Td'Clk) and cycle (Td'cyc) were cloned from an apterygote insect, Thermobia domestica. Structural analysis showed that Td'CLK includes bHLH, PAS-A, PAS-B domains but lacks a polyglutamine repeat in the C terminal region that is implicated for transcriptional activity in Drosophila CLK. Td'CYC contains a BCTR domain in its C terminal in addition to the common domains found in Drosophila CYC, i.e. bHLH, PAS-A, PAS-B domains. Unlike in Drosophila, Td'Clk mRNA levels showed no significant daily fluctuation, while Td'cyc exhibited rhythmic expression. A single injection of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) of Td'Clk or Td'cyc into the abdomen of adult firebrats effectively knocked down respective mRNA levels and abolished the rhythmic expression of Td'cyc. Most Td'Clk or Td'cyc dsRNA-injected firebrats lost their circadian locomotor rhythm in constant darkness up to 30 days after injection, whereas those injected with DsRed2 dsRNA as a negative control clearly maintained it. From these results, it is likely that Td'Clk and Td'cyc are involved in the circadian clock machinery in the firebrat. However, the structure and expression profile of Td'Clk and Td'cyc more closely resembles those of mammals than Drosophila. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Teaching hospitals have three roles: health care provision, training of healthcare professionals, and medical research. These roles lead to frequent interactions with pharmaceutical and medical device companies, inevitably raising risks of conflicts of interests. Therefore, policies to manage conflict of interests (C01) are crucial. This study aims to examine COI policies in French teaching hospitals. Methods All French teaching hospitals (n = 32) were included in this study. All hospitals websites were screened for institutional COI policies and curriculum on COI, using standardized keyword searches. More data were collected through a questionnaire addressed to each chief executive officer (CEO) of the teaching hospital. We used predefined criteria (n = 20) inspired by similar surveys on COI policies in French, US and Canadian medical schools, with some additions to reflect the local hospital context. A global score for each hospital, ranging from 0 to 60 (higher scores denoting stronger policies) was calculated by summing points obtained for each criterion. Results All 32 hospitals had websites; 21 hospitals listed policies or regulations on their websites or provided them on request. In December 2017, 17 (53.1%) had rules and regulations for some items only, four of which (12.5%) have considered implementing a policy, and only two (6.3%) have begun implementation. 15 (46.9%) had no evidence of COI policies and a null score. The maximum score was 24 out of 60. Conclusion This is the first systematic assessment of COI policies in teaching hospitals in France. Such policies are needed to protect patients, clinicians and students from undue commercial influence. Despite public and political pressure for better management of COI, few teaching hospitals have implemented comprehensive and protective policies, and some hospitals lacked policies altogether. These results highlight the need for greater attention to management of COI within teaching hospitals. One potential solution would be to integrate COI policies into hospital accreditation procedures, in order to ensure a baseline of management at all teaching hospitals.",6,6,Science & Technology - Other Topics

In this study, we investigated whether students' cognitive ability and their need for cognition (i.e., their tendency to actively seek, engage in and enjoy effortful cognitive activity) affects students' motivational responses to adequately challenging schoolwork. Building on data from a large-scale survey among 3002 Flemish 7th graders, we found that adequately challenging schoolwork had a more favorable effect on intrinsic motivation and schoolwork engagement for students high in need for cognition than for students low in need for cognition.

However, their role in cognitive function remains unclear. We previously reported that the cognitive enhancer ST101, which stimulates T-VGCCs in rat cortical slices, was a potential Alzheimer's disease therapeutic. Here, we introduce a more potent T-VGCC enhancer, SAK3 (ethyl 8'-methy1-2',4dioxo-2-(piperidin-l-y1)-2'H-spiro[cyclopentane-1,3'-imidazo [1,2-a]pyridin]-2-ene-3-carboxylate), and characterize its pharmacological properties in brain. Based on whole cell patch-clamp analysis, SAK3 (0.01-10 nM) significantly enhanced Cav3.1 currents in neuro2A cells ectopically expressing Cav3.1. SAK3 (0.1-10 nM nM) also enhanced Cav3.3 but not Cav3.2 currents in the transfected cells. Notably, Cav3.1 and Cav3.3 T-VGCCs were localized in cholinergic neurve systems in hippocampus and in the medial septum. Indeed, acute oral administration of SAK3 (0.5 mg/kg, p.o.), but not ST101 (0.5 mg/kg, p.o.) significantly enhanced acetylcholine (ACh) release in the hippocampal CAl region of nave mice. Moreover, acute SAK3 (0.5 mg/kg, p.o.) administration significantly enhanced hippocampal ACh levels in olfactory-bulbectomized(OBX) mice, rescuing impaired memory-related behaviors. Treatment of OBX mice with the T-VGCC-specific blocker NNC 55-0396 (12.5 mg/kg, i.p.) antagonized both enhanced ACh release and memory improvements elicited by SAK3 administration. We also observed that SAK3-induced ACh releases were significantly blocked in the hippocampus from Cav3.1 knockout (KO) mice. These findings suggest overall that T-VGCCs play a key role in cognition by enhancing hippocampal ACh release and that the cognitive enhancer SAK3 could be a candidate therapeutic in Alzheimer's disease.

Given that standard hours become discontinuous at certain establishment sizes, we employ a regression discontinuity design to estimate the impacts of the policy change. The theory predicts that policy change should unambiguously reduce hours worked in establishments with an initial workweek longer than the new standard hours but shorter than the old standard hours. The policy impact is expected to be zero for establishments with short hours, while it is ambiguous for establishments with very long hours. Indeed, the empirical analysis indicates that the reduction of standard hours significantly decreased hours worked in establishments whose hours are predicted to be between the old and new standard hours. Even in establishments with reduced working hours, monthly wages and annual bonuses did not decrease, leading to the increase in labor costs per hour. As a result, the policy change did not contribute to job creation. This paper demonstrates the importance of considering heterogeneous treatment effects, rather than the average treatment effects. When the policy impacts totally differ among groups, as in our case, estimating only the average treatment effect could mask the real impact. In addition, some groups actually affected by the policy may not be the ones targeted by the policy makers; in such cases, if there are heterogeneous treatment effects, unexpected outcomes can occur.

In most ball games, coaches assess motor, physical, and technical skills on a regular basis in early stages of talent identification and development. However, selection processes are complex, are often unstructured, and lack clear-cut theory-based knowledge. For example, little is known about the relevance of the testing process to the final selection of the young prospects. The purpose of this study was to identify motor, physical, and skill variables that could provide coaches with relevant information in the selection process of young team handball players. In total, 405 players (12-13 years of age at the beginning of the testing period) were recommended by their coaches to undergo a battery of tests prior to selection to the Junior National Team. This number is the sum of all players participating in the different phases of the program. However, not all of them took part in each testing phase. The battery included physical measurements (height and weight), a 4 x 10-m running test, explosive power tests (medicine ball throw and standing long jump), speed tests (a 20-m sprint from a standing position and a 20-m sprint with a flying start), and a slalom dribbling test. Comparisons between those players eventually selected to the Junior National Team 2-3 years later with those not selected demonstrated that only the skill test served as a good indicator. In all other measurements, a wide overlap could be seen between the results of the selected and nonselected players. It is suggested that future studies investigate the usefulness of tests reflecting more specific physical ability and cognitive characteristics.",88,90,Sport Sciences

But dose dependent nephrotoxicity is the major drawback in majority of platinum based chemotherapy regimens. Recent reports have shown that inflammatory pathways are the main offender for cisplatin induced nephrotoxicity. The present study was undertaken to assess the effect of rosiglitazone, a PPAR gamma agonist and an anti-inflammatory agent, on cisplatin induced nephrotoxicity, and its anticancer activity in DMBA induced breast cancer rats. Methods: Mammary tumours were induced in female Sprague-Dawley rats by feeding orally with dimethylbenz [a]anthracene (DMBA) (60 mg/kg). Cisplatin induced nephropathy was assessed by measurements of blood urea nitrogen, albumin and creatinine levels. Posttranslational modifications of histone H3, mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase p38 expression and PPAR-gamma expression were examined by western blotting. Results: Our data shows involvement of TNF-alpha in preventing cisplatin induced nephrotoxicity by rosiglitazone. Rosiglitazone pre-treatment to cisplatin increases the expression of p38, PPAR-gamma in mammary tumours and shows maximum tumour reduction. Furthermore, cisplatin induced changes in histone acetylation, phosphorylation and methylation of histone H3 in mammary tumours was ameliorated by pre-treatment of rosiglitazone. Suggesting, PPAR-gamma directly or indirectly alters aberrant gene expression in mammary tumours by changing histone modifications. Conclusion: To best of our knowledge this is the first report which shows that pre-treatment of rosiglitazone synergizes the anticancer activity of cisplatin and minimizes cisplatin induced nephrotoxicity in DMBA induced breast cancer.",61,63,Oncology

The pepper, used as a spice, also serves as a traditional medicine in many countries. Black pepper contains many different substances; the most active of these is piperine, which exerts anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-cancer effects. However, piperine is a poorly absorbed alkaloid, and high concentrations may be toxic. Therefore, its medicinal uses remain limited. Here, we extracted piperine from black peppers collected at Chu Se, created piperine and anti-CD133 monoclonal antibodies (mAb(boolean AND)CD133) containing nanoliposomal complexes (PMCs), and evaluated their inhibitory effects on cancer stem cells (CSCs) in vitro. The physical properties of PMCs showed an approximated diamater of 170 nm, a PDI of 0.23, zeta potential of -9.38 mV, and an encapsulated efficiency of 73.33 +/- 9.09%. The PMCs significantly inhibited NTERA-2 cell growth (IC50 = 435.3 +/- 4.3 mu M), but were not toxic to healthy cells (IC50 >500 mu M). The PMCs remarkably affected the CSC surface marker expressed level of which the CD44(+)/CD133(+) population was only 2.12% compared with 21.72% for blank nanoliposomes. The NTERA-2 antiproliferative activities of PMCs might be associated with their G2 cell cycle phase arresting and caspase-3 inducible activities (up to 1.51 times) (P < 0.05). The nanoliposomal complex also significantly inhibited the proliferation of NTERA-2 cells in three dimensional tumorspheroids with an IC50 = 245.82 +/- 11.44 mu M and reduced the size by up to 41.50 +/- 4.31% (P < 0.05). Thus, the PMCs proved their enhanced potential biomedical and pharmacological applications in targeted cancer therapies.",2,2,Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Food Science & Technology

The supplier can produce inputs of different qualities. As quality is not verifiable, a selfish supplier always produces the quality that minimizes his costs. A supplier that is motivated by reciprocity may instead produce the quality that maximizes the revenues of the buyer. Accordingly, reciprocity could increase the use of the market. To trigger reciprocal behavior the buyer must propose a contract that the seller perceives to be kind. We find that for reciprocal behavior to show up, it is enough that the supplier is moderately reciprocal. Lastly, we provide some intuitions about how our results change if the supplier is liquidity-constrained and must be granted non-negative profits in all circumstances.",0,0,Business & Economics

Here, we quantitatively determined the rate constants of elementary reaction steps, including binding (k(on)), translational movement (k(tr)), and dissociation (k(off)) with single-molecule fluorescence imaging. The k(on) for a single chitin microfibril was 2.1 x 10(9) M (1) mu m 1 s (1). The k(off) showed two components, k(off)(fas)t (3.2 s(-1), 78%) and k(off)(slow) (0.38 s(-1), 22%), corresponding to bindings to different crystal surfaces. From the k(on), k(off)(fas)t, k(off)(slow) and ratio of fast and slow dissociations, dissociation constants for low and high affinity sites were estimated as 2.0 x 10(-9) M mu m and 8.1 x 10(-10) M mu m, respectively. The k(tr) was 52.5 nm s(-1), and processivity was estimated as 60.4. The apparent inconsistency between high turnover (52.5 s(-1)) calculated from k(tr) and biochemically determined low k(cat) (2.6 s(-1)) is explained by a low ratio (4.8%) of productive enzymes on the chitin surface (52.5 s(-1) x 0.048 = 2.5 s(-1)).

The Q(y) absorption band of Chl f in the B800 cavity was shifted by 14 nm to longer wavelength compared to that of the corresponding five-coordinated monomer in acetone. This redshift was larger than that of Chl a and Chl b. Resonance Raman spectroscopy indicated hydrogen bonding between the 2-formyl group of Chl f and the LH2 polypeptide. These results suggest that this hydrogen bonding contributes to the Q(y) redshift of Chl f. Furthermore, the Q(y) redshift of Chl f in the B800 cavity was smaller than that of Chl d.

A small amount of lubricant as 90 mL/h was provided directly into the cutting zone during deep drilling under ultrasonic vibrations exerted on the tool. A comparative experimental study was implemented for two types of drilling processes: conventional drilling (CD) and ultrasonic-assisted drilling (UAD). For each set, three different methods of lubricant feeding methods were applied, including flooding, MQL, and MQL with graphene nanoparticles. A continuous drilling process using a through-hole drill bit (D = 5 mm, L = 8D) for AISI SUS 304 stainless steel was implemented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The results show that the approach proposed can overcome the bottleneck in deep drilling using MQL, providing a higher production rate, longer tool life, and better machining performance in terms of cutting forces and processing ability. Using the newly proposed method, continuous drilling can be done in critical machining conditions, which are typically recommended by the tool manufacturers.

Background data: Currently there is no satisfactory, efficient method for long-term white hair removal. Methods: We conducted a randomized clinical trial of hirsute patients with excessive white hair on the chin and cheeks. In addition to IPL, the patients were randomly assigned to have their white hair colored with either black eyeliner or black hair dye as an adjunct to IPL aided for of six sessions (with a 4-week interval between sessions). The primary efficacy outcome, which was defined as the outcome after six sessions of therapy, was scored as poor (<30%), fair (30-60%) or good (>60%) response to white hair removal in predefined areas. The secondary outcome was recurrence 6 months after the final therapy session. Results: In the eyeliner group (n = 31), 15 (48.4%) individuals showed a fair response, and 16 (51.6%) individuals showed a good response. In the color-dye group (n = 31), 1 (3.2%), 17 (54.8%) and 13 (41.9%) participants scored poor, fair, and good, respectively. There were no differences in clinician judgment of the treatment success between the eyeliner and color-dye groups after the six therapy sessions (p = 0.895). Thirty-one patients had 6 months of visits (11 in the hair dye and 20 in the eyeliner group). Three participants in the color-dye group and five participants in the eyeliner group failed to show improvement 6 months after the laser surgery. There was no distinguishable pattern of failure between the two study groups (p = 1). Conclusion: This study supports that hair coloring is an efficient and feasible technique that can be combined with IPL to eliminate white facial hair.",10,10,Surgery

Neural processing during executive function tasks remains largely unknown, especially in young bilingual children. Methodology: Using functional near-infrared spectroscopy, this study examined whether young children who attended an immersion second-language program demonstrated enhanced cognitive shifting and lateral prefrontal activation. Data and analysis: We recruited children (N= 24) who attended an international nursery school, and examined whether their performance on cognitive shifting, and whether the oxygenated hemoglobin changes in the prefrontal regions during the task, were correlated with the children's second-language verbal age and the length of time the children had been speaking the second language. Findings: Results revealed that the verbal age of the second language and the length of time speaking it were significantly correlated with behavioral performances of cognitive shifting tasks. However, they were not correlated with the activations in the lateral prefrontal regions. Originality: We examined the neural correlates of bilingual effects on cognitive shifting and prefrontal activations in young children. Implications: The results suggest that second-language experience may not be directly related to neural processing in the lateral prefrontal cortex, at least in young children.",8,8,Linguistics

Umbelliferone was also incorporated but in this case no bergapten was produced; instead, skimmin, umbelliferone monoglucoside, was detected. To determine whether conversion of psoralen to bergapten was due to enzyme induction by precursor feeding, the transcript accumulations and enzyme activities of bergaptol O-methyltransferase (BMT, EC 2.1.1.69), which catalyzes the last step of bergapten synthesis, and of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL, EC 4.3.1.5), which catalyzes the initial step of the phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathway and is known as a marker enzyme of elicitation, were examined. The results showed that both the expression and the activity of BMT were always detected in all cells, including control cells. Since PAL was slightly induced in the cells supplied with/without precursors, phenylethyl alcohol (PEA, a competitive inhibitor of PAL) was applied to suspension cells prior to the addition of psoralen. PAL activity was effectively inhibited by PEA at 1-5 mM concentrations. Under these conditions, PEA did not affect bergapten production by cell cultures fed with psoralen at all.

Third, analyzing cognitive characteristics, we pay special attention to creative imagery: an understudied yet critical aspect of creative potential. By meta-analyzing available evidence from interventional studies, we show that there are multiple effective approaches to enhancing creative imagery, so-in a sense-supporting creative potential might be democratized as well by going beyond creativity training.

The multifaceted effectors of Alzheimer's disease primarily include Tau, amyloid-beta along with hyper activation of kinases, oxidative stress and mutations etc., makes it challenging to design therapeutics. Tau is a microtubule-associating protein, which is subjected to cellular stress resulting in the formation of neurofibrillary tangles, leading to loss of affinity for microtubules. This causes loss of microtubule stability and in turn alters axonal integrity. In the present work, emphasis towards understanding interaction of nickel with Tau was made. Metals such as iron, zinc, copper and lead etc., are known to modulate Tau conformation and enhance its aggregation. Our results showed the deliverance of Tau aggregation by nickel and its synthetic morpholine conjugate. Nickel prevents aggregation by inducing degradation of Tau as evidenced by SDS-PAGE and TEM.

Expression level of two memory genes encoded to transcription factor (NAC09 and NAC109) and one gene encoded enzyme.1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase (P5CS1) were increased in the first stress and decreased in third stress. Our results demonstrate that changing of biochemical parameters of soybean seedlings can be seen as the strong indications of drought stress memory.

Gold nanoparticles were loaded on rutile TiO2 particles with a mean size of 80 nm (Au/TiO2) by the deposition precipitation method. The surface of SnO2 particles with a mean size of 100 nm was modified by copper(II) oxide clusters (CuO/SnO2) with the loading amount (Gamma/Cu ions nm(-2)) precisely controlled by the chemisorption-calcination cycle technique. Two mesoporous overlayers of Au/TiO2 and CuO/SnO2 were coated side by side on glass substrates with a fluorine-doped tin oxide film (FTO) using the doctor blade method (Au/mp-TiO2|FTO|CuO/mp-SnO2). As test reactions for assessing the visible-light activity, we carried out gas-phase decomposition of acetaldehyde and liquid-phase oxidation of alcohol. In each reaction, this bi-overlayer type catalyst shows a high level of visible-light activity much exceeding those of Au/TiO2 particles and a Au/mp-TiO2|FTO mono-overlayer type catalyst [J. Phys. Chem. C, 2014, 118, 26887]. To confirm the origin of the striking visible-light activity, we studied the electrocatalytic activity of CuO/mp-SnO2|FTO electrodes for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Both the visible-light activity of Au/mp-TiO2|FTO|CuO/mp-SnO2 and the electrocatalytic activity of CuO/mp-SnO2|FTO for ORR strongly depend on the Gamma value. A good positive correlation has been found between the visible-light activities and the electrocatalytic activity for ORR. The striking activity of the present bi-overlayer type catalyst can be attributed to the efficient and long-range charge separation by the vectorial electron transport (Au(oxidation sites) -> TiO2 -> FTO, SnO2 -> CuO(reduction sites)) and the excellent electrocatalytic activity of the CuO clusters.",5,5,Chemistry; Physics

This review summarizes the major geochemical processes controlling the release, speciation, fate, and distribution of inorganic arsenic in mine drainage and natural systems. Arsenic speciation depends highly on redox potential and pH of the solution, and arsenite can be oxidized to the less toxic arsenate form. Homogeneous oxidation of arsenite occurs rather slowly while its heterogeneous oxidation on mineral surfaces can greatly enhance the reaction rates. Little evidence suggests that precipitation reaction limits the concentrations of arsenic in natural water, while co-precipitation may lead to rapid arsenic removal when large amount of iron hydroxides precipitate out of the aqueous phase upon neutralization of the mine drainage. Both arsenate and arsenite adsorb on common metal oxides and clay minerals through formation of inner-sphere and/or outer-sphere complexes, controlling arsenic concentration in natural water bodies. Arsenite adsorbs less strongly than arsenate in the typical pH range Of natural water and is more mobile. Part of the adsorbed arsenic species can be exchanged by common anions (e.g., PO43- and SO42-). especially phosphate, which leads to their re-mobilization. Understanding the geochemistry of arsenic is helpful for predicting its mobility and fate in AMD and natural systems, and for designing of cost-effective remediation/treatment strategies to reduce the occurrence and risk of arsenic contamination.

Yet, how changing salinities physiologically challenge aquatic organisms, such as mayflies, remains remarkably understudied. Moreover, it is not well understood the degree to which species respond and acclimate to salinity changes. Our lab is developing the Baetid mayfly, N. triangulifer, as a model organism for physiological research. We have previously described acclimatory changes in both ion flux rates and altered mRNA transcript levels in response to chronic exposures to elevated major ion concentrations at the whole animal level. In the present study, we use shotgun proteomics to identify the specific proteins associated with apical ion transport and how their abundance changes in response to chronic salinity exposures in gills. Gills were isolated from the penultimate nymphal stage of N. triangulifer reared under control culture conditions, elevated NaCl (157 mg L-1 Na), elevated CaCl2 (121 mg L-1 Ca), elevated Ca/MgSO4 (735 mg L-1 SO4). These conditions mirrored those from previously published physiological work. We also acutely exposed nymphs to dilute (50% dilution of culture water with deionized water) to explore proteomic changes in the gills in response to dilute conditions. We report 710 unique peptide sequences among treatment groups, including important apical ion transporters such as Ca-ATPase, Na/K ATPase, and V-ATPase. Treatment with elevated NaCl and Ca/MgSO4 appeared to cause more significant differential protein expression (452 and 345, respectively) compared to CaCl2 and dilute groups (134 and 17, respectively). Finally, we demonstrated the breadth of physiological functions in gills by exploring non-transport related pathways found in our dataset, including ATP synthesis, calcium signaling, and oxidative stress response. We discuss our results in the context of freshwater salinization and the challenges of working with non-model species without fully sequenced and annotated genomes.",0,0,Environmental Sciences & Ecology

Using phylogenetic comparative analyses, we found that copulation duration was much longer in species with titillators than those without, but it was not longer in species with complex compared with simple titillators. A positive relationship was found between spermatophore size and copulation duration prior to ejaculate transfer, which supports the hypothesis that this represents a period of mate assessment.

Coaches of young athletes at early phases of development often use batteries of tests in order to obtain information that will be helpful in predicting their future success. However, little scientific inquiry has been conducted on the relevance of the testing process to the final selection and success of young prospects. The purpose of this study was to examine the benefits of a unique judo-specific ability test in early phases of talent development and selection. Methods. Ten judokas (12-15 years of age) underwent assessment of general ability and specific judo ability 3 times during 1994 and 1995, at about 6-month intervals. The general ability test included: sit-ups, push-ups, and side-to-side jumps. The specific judo ability test was comprised of 10 stations in which the judokas performed physical ability and skill tasks. Following the 12-month training program the judokas were ranked by the 2 national judo coaches. Eight years after the beginning of the training program, the judokas were ranked once again by the national coaches. Results. Data analysis revealed that the specific judo ability test did not correlate with either the 1995 or with the 2003 ranking. Conclusion. Because the unique judo-specific ability test was not found to be sensitive enough to accurately measure talent, it is suggested that future studies investigate the usefulness of tests reflecting a more open-skill environment.",19,19,Sport Sciences

From the MTT assay and SRB cytotoxicity assay, it is obvious that GpM cell suspension culture extract at 200 mu g/mL significantly inhibited the growth of multiple human cancer cells including hepatoma cell lines (HepG2, Huh7), lung carcinoma cell line (A549) and leukemia cell line (HL-60). Anti-cancer cell proliferation properties of GpM cell suspension culture were significantly higher than those of natural plants ' extracts. In this framework, GpM in cell suspension cultures was found to inhibit the proliferation of several human cancer cells. Biomass accumulation of GpM in cell suspension cultures may contribute to the development of efficient strategies for plant-derived anticancer compound production.",1,1,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology

To perform their functions, microtubules are mechanically stressed and, thereby, susceptible to structural defects. Local variations in mechanical properties caused by these defects modulate their biological functions, including binding and transportation of microtubule-associated proteins. Therefore, assessing the local mechanical properties of microtubules and analyzing their dynamic response to mechanical stimuli provide insight into fundamental processes. It is, however, not trivial to control defect formation, gather mechanical information at the same time, and subsequently image the result at a high temporal resolution at the molecular level with minimal delay. In this work, we describe the so-called in-line force curve mode based on high-speed atomic force microscopy. This method is directly applied to create defects in microtubules at the level of tubulin dimers and monitor the following dynamic processes around the defects. Furthermore, force curves obtained during defect formation provide quantitative mechanical information to estimate the bonding energy between tubulin dimers.",14,14,Chemistry; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Materials Science; Physics

Although DUSP6 expression is tightly regulated by ERK1/2 signaling, the molecular mechanism of this regulation remains partially understood. In this work, we show that the transcriptional repressor CIC functions downstream of the ERK1/2 signaling to negatively regulate DUSP6 expression. CIC directly represses DUSP6 transcription by binding to three cis-regulatory elements (CREs) in DUSP6 promoter. p90RSK, a downstream target of ERK1/2, phosphorylates CIC at S173 and S301 sites, which creates a 14-3-3 recognition motif, resulting in 14-3-3-mediated nuclear export of CIC and derepression of DUSP6. Finally, we demonstrate that the oncogenic CIC-DUX4 fusion protein acts as a transcriptional activator of DUSP6 and its nuclear/cytoplasmic distribution remains regulated by ERK1/2 signaling. These results complete an ERK1/2/p90RSK/CIC/DUSP6 negative feedback circuit and elucidate the molecular mechanism of how RTK/MAPK signaling harnesses the transcriptional repressor activity of CIC in mammalian cells.",15,15,Science & Technology - Other Topics

Evaluations in vitro showed that CCN3 repressed epiphyseal chondrocyte proliferation, while promoting matrix production in multiple assays performed. Furthermore, CCN3 enhanced the articular chondrocytic phenotype; whereas it repressed the one representing endochondral ossification. Additionally, the phenotype of growth plate chondrocytes and chondrogenic progenitors also appeared to be affected by CCN3 in a similar manner. These findings suggest a significant role of CCN3 in inducing chondrocytes to articular ones during joint formation. (C) 2011 Federation of European Biochemical Societies. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Municipal solid waste (MSW) incineration should be considered a high priority source of dioxin emissions because it is playing an increasingly more important role in waste management. MSW incineration in China has much higher emission rates of dioxins than in the developed countries, partially resulting from the gaps in the technologies of incineration and flue gas cleaning. Moreover, the current management policies and practices also contribute significantly to the problem. We recommend lowering dioxin emission standard, strengthening fly ash management, and improving regulation enforcement to reduce dioxin releases into the environment from MSW incineration. We also propose that alternative strategies should be considered on dioxin control and call for an expansion of economic instruments in waste management to reduce waste generation and thus the need for incineration.

Due to the stronger cytotoxic activity of hydrogenated AA (HAA) against NTERA-2 cancer stem cells (CSCs) than AA itself, HAA was co-conjugated with CD133 monoclonal antibody (mAb<^>CD133) into nanoliposomal particles (AMC). This nanoliposomal complex is expected to improved HAA activities against CSCs based on the targeting capacity of mAb<^>CD133 toward CD133, a typical CSCs' surface marker. AMC was manufactured with a mean size of 100.9 nm, a zeta potential of -40.7 mV, and a PDI of 0.283. We report a 100% encapsulation efficiency of HAA into liposomes and a 90.7% conjugation efficiency with mAb<^>CD133. The penetration of AMC into NTERA-2 CSCs after 2 h was 83.7%. The AMC complex inhibited NTERA-2 growth with an IC50 (inhibition concentration at 50%) value of 75.83 +/- 6.70 mu M, showing the targeting ability and lower toxicity (IC50 > 100 mu M) on healthy cells. The AMC nanoparticles also demonstrated significant potential apoptotic induction by activating caspase 3 activity by up to 2.57 and 2.06 folds compared to that of the negative control at 20 and 4 mu M, respectively. This induction was significant improvement in comparison with that of unconjugated HAA (P < .05). AMC presented a clear effect on the solid structure of NTERA-2 spheroids and significantly suppressed the proliferation of CSCs in the 3D tumorspheres with an IC50 = 64.25 +/- 3.15 mu M, compared to the free form with an IC50 = 82.22 +/- 0.65 mu M (P < .05).

This article provides an overview of the WTE industry, discusses the major challenges in expanding WTE incineration in China, namely, high capital and operational costs, equipment corrosion, air pollutant emissions, and fly ash disposal. A perspective on MSW as a renewable energy source in China is also presented. Currently, only approximately 13% of MSW generated in China is disposed in WTE facilities.

We then investigate unequal patterns of bequest division in Japan to understand parental bequest motives. Utilizing institutional characteristics that are specific to Japan allows us to examine parental motives. We find that while the patterns of bequest division look generally consistent with most of the parental bequest motives suggested in the literature, such as the dynastic and the strategic motive, parents do not necessarily bequeath more to economically disadvantaged children.",5,5,Demography; Business & Economics

Here we report that patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) whose tumours contained higher levels of bacteria of the genus Peptostreptococcus had higher probability of long-term survival. We then show that in mice with murine OSCC tumours injected with oral microbiota from patients with OSCCs, antitumour responses were enhanced by the subcutaneous delivery of an adhesive hydrogel incorporating silver nanoparticles (which inhibited the growth of bacteria competing with Peptostreptococcus) alongside the intratumoural delivery of the bacterium P. anaerobius (which upregulated the levels of Peptostreptococcus). We also show that in mice with subcutaneous or orthotopic murine OSCC tumours, combination therapy with the two components (nanoparticle-incorporating hydrogel and exogenous P. anaerobius) synergized with checkpoint inhibition with programmed death-1.

A comparison of human breast cancer cell lines, which differ in the levels of endogenous Notch4, implicated the protein in regulating susceptibility to apoptosis triggered by genomic damage. In agreement with this observation, increased susceptibility to genotoxic damage was observed following siRNA ablations of Notch4 in two breast cancer cell lines. Further, overexpressing Notch4 intracellular domain (NIC4) tagged to GFP (NIC4-GFP), protected cells from apoptosis triggered by genotoxic drugs. In cells immune-stained for endogenous Notch4, protein was detected in the nucleolus and nucleoplasm, which was also confirmed by the co-localization of NIC4-GFP with RFP-tagged nucleolar proteins in breast cancer cells or the unrelated HEK cell line. Linking functional outcomes to nucleolar localization, NIC4-GFP protection from apoptosis, required the nucleolar proteins Nucleolin and Fibrillarin. Consistently, immunoprecipitation analysis revealed associations between nucleolar proteins-Nucleolin and Nucleophosmin-and Notch4. Microscopy-based biophysical analysis of live cells showed that nucleolar and nucleoplasmic pools of NIC4-GFP are mobile, with some sequestration of nucleolar NIC4-GFP pools. A nucleolar excluded form, NIC4_3RA-GFP, generated by site-directed mutagenesis of the nucleolar localization sequence in NIC4, could not protect from apoptosis triggered by genotoxic stressors. However, transcriptional activity or protection from apoptosis triggered by endoplasmic stress was comparable in cells expressing NIC4_3RA-GFP or NIC4-GFP. Together, the data show that nucleolar localization of NIC4 is critical for the regulation of genomic damage and may be uncoupled from its activities in the nucleoplasm. This study identifies intrinsic features of NIC4 that regulate signaling outcomes activated by the receptor by controlling its spatial localization.",10,10,Cell Biology

The supported ionic liquid membranes were characterized by SEM. The initial transmembrane pressures were investigated for each type of impregnated membrane. The CO2/CH4 single gas and mixed gas permeability (CO2 and CH4) have been investigated. The results showed that the CO2/CH4 ideal selectivities and mixed gas selectivities reached 15.45-23.9 and 13.91-22.82, respectively (equivalent to separation yields of 93.3-95.98 %). The 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate impregnated membrane leads to a slightly lower CO2/CH4 selectivity, however, this ionic liquid is stable, free of halogen and has a low price. The impregnated membranes prepared from polyvinylidene fluoride are more-stable than those from polyethersulfone support, and have a higher affinity for CO2 compared to other gas. The obtained high CO2/CH4 selectivities indicate that immobilized membranes can be used for CO2 separation processes.",5,5,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Engineering

Lycopene expected role was to control lipid peroxidation, by scavenging free radicals generated by UV-irradiation, in the presence and in the absence of selected photosensitizer, benzophenone. This work shows that lycopene undergoes to UV-induced destruction (bleaching), highly dependent on the incident photons energy input, more expressed in the presence than in the absence of benzophenone.

Both remarkable change in spectrum and divergence of spin-spin relaxation (T-2) are observed with decreasing temperature, suggesting a static magnetic ordering in this material. Moreover, the broadened Li-7 spectrum also shows a characteristic three-peak structure. Comparison of linewidth between Li-7 and Se-77 spectra indicates that there is a ferromagnetic component along the external field direction and it happens on Fe sites in the (Li-0.8 Fe-0.2) OH layer rather than the FeSe layer, which is also responsible for the three-peak structure of the Li-7 spectrum with (Li-0.8 Fe-0.2) random occupation. The field-dependent spectrum and T-2 suggest that the above ferromagnetic component is induced by external magnetic field.

Indeed, patients have high hopes for a cell-based therapy. However, there are numerous practical challenges for clinical translation. One major problem is that only very low numbers of donor cells survive and achieve functional integration into the host. Glial scar tissue in chronic neurodegenerative disorders strongly inhibits regeneration, and this inhibition must be overcome to accomplish successful cell transplantation. Intraneural cell transplantation is considered to be the best way to deliver cells to the host. We questioned this view with experiments in vivo on a rat glial scar model of the auditory system. Our results show that intraneural transplantation to the auditory nerve, preceded by chondroitinase ABC (ChABC)-treatment, is ineffective. There is no functional recovery, and almost all transplanted cells die within a few weeks. However, when donor cells are placed on the surface of a ChABC-treated gliotic auditory nerve, they autonomously migrate into it and recapitulate glia- and neuron-guided cell migration modes to repair the auditory pathway and recover auditory function. Surface transplantation may thus pave the way for improved functional integration of donor cells into host tissue, providing a less invasive approach to rescue clinically important neural tracts.",18,18,Science & Technology - Other Topics

Morphology of the temporal region of the reptilian skull is highly diverse and historically it has been treated as an important character for classifying reptiles and has helped us understand the ecology and physiology of each species. However, the developmental mechanism that generates diversity of reptilian skull morphology is poorly understood. We reveal a potential developmental basis that generates morphological diversity in the temporal region of the reptilian skull by performing a comparative analysis of gene expression in the embryos of reptile species with different skull morphology. By investigating genes known to regulate early osteoblast development, we find dorsoventrally broadened unique expression of the early osteoblast marker, Runx2, in the temporal region of the head of turtle embryos that do not form temporal fenestrae. We also observe that Msx2 is also uniquely expressed in the mesenchymal cells distributed at the temporal region of the head of turtle embryos. Furthermore, through comparison of gene expression pattern in the embryos of turtle, crocodile, and snake species, we find a possible correlation between the spatial patterns of Runx2 and Msx2 expression in cranial mesenchymal cells and skull morphology of each reptilian lineage. Regulatory modifications of Runx2 and Msx2 expression in osteogenic mesenchymal precursor cells are likely involved in generating morphological diversity in the temporal region of the reptilian skull.",12,12,Science & Technology - Other Topics

Despite of the much progress achieved so far, there is still an urgent need to explore new biomaterials to construct a reliable and efficient tissue-tissue interface and a general fabrication strategy to expand from single-organ OOC to multi-organ OOC in an easy manner. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy to prepare doublecompartment organ-on-a-chip (DC-OOC) using electrospun poly(l-lactic acid)/collagen I (PLLA/Col I) nanofiber membrane as tissue-tissue interface. The unique features of PLLA/Col I nanofiber membrane like excellent biocompatibility, strong affinity to multiple cells, adjustable orientation, controllable thickness and porosity endow the tissue-tissue interface with excellent semi-permeability, appropriate mechanical support, inducible cell orientation, good cell adhesion and proliferation. The integration of 3D printing technology during the fabrication process enables precise size control of the tissue-tissue interface and stable bonding with microfluidic channels. More importantly, our fabrication strategy and OOC configuration makes it easy to extend from DC-OOC to multi-compartment organ-on-a-chip (MC-OOC). To show its possible application, in vitro jaundice disease model is established by constructing blood vessel/skin/liver/lung organ-on-a-chip via MC-OOC. The downward trends of the cell viability after perfusion of bilirubin, the variation in cell sensitivity to bilirubin for different type of cells and recovery of cell viability after blue light therapy prove the feasibility of this jaundice disease model. We believe this general strategy of constructing tissue-tissue interface and multi-organ OOC can be used for many other in vitro physiological and pathological models.",12,12,Materials Science

All animals were fed a HFD. Retinal ganglion cell (RGC) density was estimated by labeling with fluorogold and immunohistochemistry. A potent calpain inhibitor, SNJ-1945, was administered daily until the animals were sacrificed. In vitro, oxidative stress-induced RGC loss was evaluated in a high glucose culture medium with and without SNJ-1945. Retinal mRNA of calpain-1 and calpain-2 was measured by quantitative RT-PCR. Pre-apoptotic substrates of cleaved alpha-fodrin and synaptophysin protein were quantified by immunoblot analysis. Axonal damage was examined in transverse sections of the optic nerve. A HFD and hyperglycemia significantly increased RGC and axonal degeneration 3 weeks into the experiment. Levels of cleaved a-fodrin were increased. In the CAST KO mice, the neurotoxicity was augmented significantly. Gene manipulation of CAST and orally administered SNJ-1945 successfully modified calpain levels in the retina and prevented RGC death. In vitro, a high-glucose culture of retinal cells without antioxidants showed more RGC death than that with antioxidant treatment. The expression of synaptophysin was significantly suppressed by SNJ-1945 treatment. These results suggest that calpain plays a crucial role in metabolic-induced RGC degeneration caused by hyperglycemia and oxidative stress. Antioxidant and calpain inhibition offers important opportunities for future neuroprotective treatment against RGC death in various metabolic stress-induced diseases including DR.

The BBF2H7 N terminus functions as a transcription factor to promote the expression of ER-Golgi trafficking-related genes and plays crucial roles in chondrocyte differentiation. Here, we found that the BBF2H7 C terminus is secreted into the extracellular space as a signaling molecule for cell-to-cell communication. The secreted BBF2H7 C terminus directly binds to both Indian hedgehog and its receptor Patched-1, followed by activation of Hedgehog signaling, resulting in promoting the proliferation of neighboring chondrocytes.

However, the complicated and rigorous thermal deposition process of metal contact electrodes remains a challenging issue for reducing the energy pay-back period in commercial PSCs, as the ubiquitous one-time use of a contact electrode wastes limited resources and pollutes the environment. Here, a nanoporous Au film electrode fabricated by a simple dry transfer process is introduced to replace the thermally evaporated Au electrode in PSCs. A high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.0% is demonstrated in PSCs with the nanoporous Au film electrode. Moreover, the electrode is recycled more than 12 times to realize a further reduced fabrication cost of PSCs and noble metal materials consumption and to prevent environmental pollution. When the nanoporous Au electrode is applied to flexible PSCs, a PCE of 17.3% and superior bending durability of approximate to 98.5% after 1000 cycles of harsh bending tests are achieved.

This is a system describing a charged particle moving in the Coulomb field plus the field of a SO(8) monopole in a nine-dimensional space. Interestingly, this problem is equivalent to a 16-dimensional harmonic oscillator via the Hurwitz transformation. In the present paper, we report on the multiseparability, a common property of superintegrable systems, and the superintegrability of the problem. First, we show the solvability of the Schrodinger equation of the problem by the variables separation method in different coordinates. Second, based on the SO(10) symmetry algebra of the system, we construct explicitly a set of seventeen invariant operators, which are all in the second order of the momentum components, satisfying the condition of superintegrability. The found number 17 coincides with the prediction of (2n - 1) law of maximal superintegrability order in the case n = 9. Until now, this law is accepted to apply only to scalar Hamiltonian eigenvalue equations in n-dimensional space; therefore, our results can be treated as evidence that this definition of superintegrability may also apply to some vector equations such as the Schrodinger equation for the nine-dimensional MICZ-Kepler problem.

Domains of micrometer size on a substrate can be selectively converted from proteinphobic (resistant to protein adsorption) to proteinphilic, allowing patterning of protein features under physiological aqueous conditions. When femtosecond laser pulses (800 nm, 1 kHz, 200-500 nJ per pulse) were focused on and scanned on the substrate, which was glass covered with the proteinphobic polymer 2-methacryloyloxyethylphosphorylcholine (MPC), the surface became proteinphilic. Surface analysis by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) reveals that the laser ablates the MPC polymer. Extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins were bound to the laser-ablated surface by physisorption. Since femtosecond laser ablation is induced under physiological aqueous conditions, this approach can form micropatterns of functional ECM proteins with minimal damage. This method was applied to pattern collagen, laminin, and gelatin on the substrate. Removal of an ECM protein from the substrate followed by replacement with another ECM protein was achieved on demand at a specific location and time by the same laser ablation method.

In CLP treated animals, the number of autolysosomes observed by electron microscopy increased over time. The number of autophagosomes in CLP animals decreased relative sham operated controls at 24 hrs after CLP, indicating that autophagy flux is already diminishing by that time. Moreover, CLP induced an increase in LC3-II/LC3-I ratio at 6-8 hrs, demonstrated in western blots, as well as an increase in GFP-LC3 dots at 6-8 hrs and 24 hrs, using immunofluorescence and anti-LC3 and LAMP1 antibodies on tissue sections from GFP-LC3 transgenic mice.

However, treatment failure can result from loss of functional cells associated with cell dispersion, low viability, and severe immune response. To overcome these limitations, various islet encapsulation approaches have been introduced. Among them, macroencapsulation offers the advantages of delivering and retrieving a large volume of islets in one system. In this study, we developed a hybrid encapsulation system composed of a macroporous polymer capsule with stagger-type membrane and assemblable structure, and a nanoporous decellularized extracellular matrix (dECM) hydrogel containing pancreatic islet-like aggregates using 3D bioprinting technique. The outer part (macroporous polymer capsule) was designed to have an interconnected porous architecture, which allows insulin-producing beta-cells encapsulated in the hybrid encapsulation system to maintain their cellular behaviors, including viability, cell proliferation, and insulin-producing function. The inner part (nanoporous dECM hydrogel), composed of the 3D biofabricated pancreatic islet-like aggregates, was simultaneously placed into the macroporous polymer capsule in one step. The developed hybrid encapsulation system exhibited biocompatibility in vitro and in vivo in terms of M1 macrophage polarization. Furthermore, by controlling the printing parameters, we generated islet-like aggregates, improving cell viability and functionality. Moreover, the 3D bioprinted pancreatic islet-like aggregates exhibited structural maturation and functional enhancement associated with intercellular interaction occurring at the beta-cell edges. In addition, we also investigated the therapeutic potential of a hybrid encapsulation system by integrating human pluripotent stem cell-derived insulin-producing cells, which are promising to overcome the donor shortage problem.

However, irrespective of their functional importance, teeth have been lost in multiple lineages of tetrapod vertebrates independently. To understand both the generality and the diversity of developmental mechanisms that cause tooth agenesis in tetrapods, we investigated expression patterns of a series of tooth developmental genes in the lower jaw of toothless turtles and compared them to that of toothed crocodiles and the chicken as a representative of toothless modern birds. In turtle embryos, we found impairment of Shh signaling in the oral epithelium and early-stage arrest of odontoblast development caused by termination of Msx2 expression in the dental mesenchyme. Our data indicate that such changes underlie tooth agenesis in turtles and suggest that the mechanism that leads to early-stage odontogenic arrest differs between birds and turtles. Our results demonstrate that the cellular and molecular mechanisms that regulate early-stage arrest of tooth development are diverse in tetrapod lineages, and odontogenic developmental programs may respond to changes in upstream molecules similarly thereby evolving convergently with feeding morphology.",32,33,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity

Here, we demonstrate that human RIF1 negatively regulates DNA replication by forming a complex with protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) that limits phosphorylation-mediated activation of the MCM replicative helicase. We identify specific residues on four MCM helicase subunits that show hyperphosphorylation upon RIF1 depletion, with the regulatory N-terminal domain of MCM4 being particularly strongly affected. In addition to this role in limiting origin activation, we discover an unexpected new role for human RIF1-PP1 in mediating efficient origin licensing. Specifically, during the G1 phase of the cell cycle, RIF1-PP1 protects the origin-binding ORC1 protein from untimely phosphorylation and consequent degradation by the proteasome. Depletion of RIF1 or inhibition of PP1 destabilizes ORC1, thereby reducing origin licensing. Consistent with reduced origin licensing, RIF1-depleted cells exhibit increased spacing between active origins. Human RIF1 therefore acts as a PP1-targeting subunit that regulates DNA replication positively by stimulating the origin licensing step, and then negatively by counteracting replication origin activation.",82,82,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Cell Biology

This problem exists for both friendship and romantic relationships. In an exploratory pilot study, participants described real-life commitment-confirming incidents in either friendship or romantic relationships. The results revealed that the same types of pro-relationship acts (e.g., throwing a surprise party) were used to communicate commitment to one's partner in both types of relationship. Using signaling theory, we predicted that costly commitment signals would be more effective than non-costly commitment signals (Hypothesis 1). Also, we predicted that failure to engage in such behaviors would communicate non-commitment, and that such failures would have a more detrimental effect on romantic relationships than friendship (Hypothesis 2). Two scenario experiments (study 1 in Japan and study 2 in the U.S.) were conducted to test these hypotheses. The results showed that costly commitment signals were more effective than non-costly commitment signals in both Japan and the U.S. In addition, the absence of situationally appropriate commitment signals (e.g., forgetting a special occasion) was substantially more damaging to romantic relationships than to friendship.

Improvement of cell-cell interactions between epithelium and mesenchyme is a potential approach to address this phenotype issue. In this study, we developed a model system for improving interactions between human iPS-derived hepatic progenitor cells (iPS-HPCs) and human iPS-derived hepatic stellate cell-like cells (iPS-HSCs). The phenotype of iPS-HSCs, including gene and protein expression profiles and vitamin A storage, resembled that of hepatic stellate cells. Direct co-culture of iPS-HSCs with iPS-HPCs significantly improved hepatocytic maturation in iPS-HPCs, such as their capacity for albumin production. Next, we generated iPS cell lines overexpressing LIM homeobox 2 (LHX2), which suppresses myofibroblastic changes in HSCs in mice. Hepatocytic maturation in iPS-HPCs was significantly increased in direct co-culture with iPS-HSCs overexpressing LHX2, but not in co-culture with a human hepatic stellate cell line (LX-2) overexpressing LHX2. LHX2 regulated the expression of extracellular matrices, such as laminin and collagen, in iPS-HSCs. In conclusion, this study provides an evidence that LHX2 upregulation in iPS-HSCs promotes hepatocytic maturation of iPS-HPCs, and indicates that genetically modified iPS-HSCs will be of value for research into cell-cell interactions.",14,14,Science & Technology - Other Topics

Direct spectrophotometry of distillation water is impossible because it is a colloid of liquid oil and law is not observed. Therefore, it is necessary to dissolve 1 ml of distillate in ethanol in the ratio 1:4, in this case we take real solution with no lipophilic fall-out on the walls of cuvette, also the light absorption law is observed. There are stable maximums in spectrums of studied oils. Optical density of these maximums is a result of summary absorption of terpenoid components (aromatic and monoterpene alcohols, its ethers). Optical density of tested and standard solutions is measured in appropriate wavelengths. Spectrophotometric method of determination of essential oil quantity in aromatic water with rose smell differs with high sensitivity (10(-5)-10(-6) gmol/l) and allows to determine oil concentration from 0,900 to 0,008 mg with an error less than 1%. At that, 1 ml is enough for analysis.

A possible cause of treatment-resistance to angiogenesis inhibitors is the growth of stem cells in a hypoxic microenvironment built inside the tumor tissue by angiogenesis inhibition. In this study, we examined the possible suppression of stem cell and cancer stem cell (CSC) expansion by hypoxic cytotoxin, TX-402. TX-402, an analogue of tirapazamine, has been developed as a hypoxia selective prodrug with inhibitory effects of HIF-1 and angiogenesis. We considered TX-402 as a possible molecular-target drug candidate for ovarian cancer due to its inhibition of CSC expansion. In this study, we found that the expressions of HIF-1 alpha and HIF-2 alpha were increased under hypoxia in serous ovarian cancer cell lines. The expressions of HIF-1 alpha and HIF-2 alpha induced under hypoxia were repressed by TX-402 in a dose-dependent manner. Next, we investigated the effects of hypoxia on the expression levels of stem cell factors, Oct4, Nanog, Sox2 and Lin28, and showed that their expressions were induced by hypoxia. It was also observed that the expressions of putative ovarian cancer stem cell markers, CD133 and CD44 were induced under hypoxia. Furthermore, TX-402 was found to dose-dependently inhibit the expressions of CSC markers and stem cell factors. Oct4 expression was repressed by HIF-2 alpha silencing, but not by HIF-1 alpha silencing, indicating that TX-402 may repress the expression of Oct4 by inhibiting HIF-2 alpha. We constructed CaOV3 spheroids as a 3-dimensional hypoxia model, in which the internal hypoxic region contained CSC-like cells expressing Oct4. The internal hypoxic region, which contained Oct4 expressing cells, disappeared following TX-402 treatment. In conclusion, hypoxia promoted the expansion of CSCs expressing CD133 and CD44 accompanied by an increase of stem cell factors. Its inhibition of hypoxia-induced CSC expansion makes TX-402 promising agent usable in combination for ovarian cancer therapy. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Furthermore, we observed a significantly lower survival rate of inner hair cells in these mice compared to control mice. Our results indicate that ERK2 plays important roles in the survival of HC in NIHL.",31,34,Science & Technology - Other Topics

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of this polymorphism on atherosclerosis, and severity and extent of CAS in unrelated Iranian population. Methods: DNA was isolated from 390 study participants and APOE genotypes were determined utilizing the polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism. Results: The APOE-epsilon 4 and -epsilon 2 allele frequencies were significantly higher in the CAS patients than in the control group (P<0.05). The association of Apo E polymorphism with the severity of stenosis was evaluated, which is according to the result that apolipoprotein E alleles were not significantly different when compared with the severity of stenosis (chi(2) = 0.84, P>0.05).

However, a direct quantification of their three-dimensional (3D) helical trajectories has not been reported, in part due to difficulty in tracking 3D swimming behavior of ciliates, especially Tetrahymena with a small, transparent cell body. Here, we conducted 3D tracking of fluorescent microbeads within a cell to directly visualize the helical swimming exhibited by Tetrahymena. Our technique showed that Tetrahymena swims along a right-handed helical path with right-handed rolling of its cell body. Using the Tetrahymena cell permeabilized with detergent treatment, we also observed that influx of Ca2+ into cilia changed the 3D-trajectory patterns of Tetrahymena swimming, indicating that the beating pattern of cilia is the determining factor in its swimming behavior.

In some organs such as gastrointestinal and urinary systems, spontaneous Ca2+ oscillation in pacermaker cells can function essentially as a Ca2+ clock mechanism, which has been originally found in pacemaking in sinoatrial node cell of the heart. The conversion of discrete Ca2+ clock events to spontaneous electrical activity is an essential step for the initiation and propagation of pacemaker activity through the multicellular organs resulting in synchronized physiological functions. Here, a model of intracellular signal transduction from a Ca2+ oscillation to initiation of electrical slow waves and their propagation were reconstituted in HEK293 cells. This was accomplished based on ryanodine receptor (RyR) type 3, Ca2+-activated ion channels, i.e. small conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channel (SK2) or Ca2+-activated Cl- channel (TMEM16A), and connexin43 being heterologously co-expressed. The propagation of electrical waves was abolished or substantially reduced by treatment with selective blockers of the expressed channels and 18 beta-glycyrrhetinic acid, a gap junction inhibitor, respectively. Thus, we demonstrated that the conversion of Ca2+ oscillation to electrical signals with cell to cell propagation can be reconstituted as a model of Ca2+ clock pacemaker activity by combinational expression of critical elements in heterologous expression system.

We show that DDX60 is an upstream factor of RIG-I that activates RIG-I signaling in a ligand-specific manner. DDX60 knockout attenuates RIG-I signaling and significantly reduces virus-induced type I IFN production in vivo. In addition, we show that DDX60 is involved in RIG-I-independent viral RNA degradation. DDX60 and RIG-I adaptor MAVS double-knockout mice reveal a role for DDX60-dependent RNA degradation in antiviral responses.

Erythritol is a permeant of Plasmodium falciparum aquaglyceroporin (PfAQP) which is a multifunctional channel responsible for maintaining hydro-homeostasis. We show that erythritol effectively inhibited growth and progression of asexual blood stage malaria parasite, and effect invasion and egress pro-cesses. It also inhibited the liver stage (sporozoites) and transmission stage parasite (gametocytes) development. Interestingly, erythritol inhibited in vivo growth of malaria parasite in mouse experimental model. It was more effective in inhibiting parasite growth both in vivo and in vitro when tested together with a known anti-malarial 'artesunate'. Additionally, erythritol showed cytokine-modulating effect which suggests its direct effect on the host immune system. Ammonia detection assay demonstrated that erythritol uptake effects the amount of ammonia release across the parasite. Our functional complementation assays suggest that PfAQP expression in yeast mutant restores its growth in hyperosmotic conditions but showed reduced growth in the presence of erythritol. Osmotic lysis assay suggests that erythritol creates osmotic stress for killing the parasite. Overall, our data bestow erythritol as a promising lead compound with an attractive antimalarial profile and could possibly be combined with known drugs without losing its efficacy.

Methods: Here, we developed a novel BLI platform on the basis of bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) for achieving a similar to 300 nm blue-to-near infrared shift of the emission (NIR-BRET) by synthesizing an array of 18 novel coelenterazine (CTZ) derivatives, named Bottle Blue (BBlue) and a unique iRFP-linked RLuc8.6-535SG fusion protein as a probe. Results: The best NIR-BRET was achieved by tuning the emission peaks of the CTZ derivatives to a Soret band of the iRFP. In mammalian cells, BBlue2.3, one of the CTZ derivatives, emits light that is similar to 50-fold brighter than DBlueC when combined with RLuc8.6-535SG, which shows stable BL kinetics. When we used a caged version of BBLue2.3, it showed a BL half decay time of over 60 minutes while maintaining the higher signal sensitivity. This NIR BL is sufficiently brighter to be used for imaging live mammalian cells at single cell level, and also for imaging metastases in deep tissues in live mice without generating considerable autoluminescence. A single-chain probe developed based on this BLI platform allowed us to sensitively image ligand antagonist-specific activation of estrogen receptor in the NIR region.

Here, we showed that TGF beta-activated kinase 1 (Tak1) is a critical molecule that regulates the activation of cell cycling and that Tak1 inhibition leads to quiescence in BMMSCs both in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, Tak1 was phosphorylated by growth factor stimulations, allowing it to bind and stabilize Yap1/Taz, which could then be localized to the nucleus. We also demonstrated that the quiescence induction by inhibiting Tak1 increased oxidized stress tolerance and improved BMMSC engraftment in intramuscular and intrabone marrow cell transplantation models.

However, these advances have not been consistently integrated into the study of sexual differences in reproductive investment, despite contemporary emphasis on the material costs associated with sexually selected traits (e.g. condition-dependence of exaggerated ornaments). Nutritional ecology suggests that material costs related to sex-specific reproductive traits should be linked to quantifiable underlying differences in the relationship between individuals of each sex and their foods. Here, we argue that applying nutritionally-explicit thought to the study of sexual reproduction should both deepen current understanding of sex-specific phenomena and broaden the tractable frontiers of sexual selection research. In support of this general argument, we examine the causes and consequences of sex-specific nutritional differences, from food selection and nutrient processing to sex-specific reproductive traits. At each level of biological organization, we highlight how a nutritionally-explicit perspective may provide new insights and help to identify new directions. Based on predictions derived at the individual level, we then consider how sex-specific nutrient limitation might influence population growth, and thus potentially broader patterns of life history evolution, using a simple population dynamics model.

A simple and efficient sorting scheme was also developed in this study to harvest high-purity and high-yield LPCs. The inducible bipotency of purified LPCs was verified; in addition, they were found to spontaneously differentiate into hepatocytes and cholangiocytes due to changes in proliferative status even without induction.

However, molecular details of the pathogenesis and physiology of this bacterium largely remain to be elucidated. Here we identify and characterize the c-di-GMP signalling network and assess its role in biofilm formation and surface associated motility. Bioinformatic analysis revealed eleven candidate genes for c-di-GMP metabolizing proteins (GGDEF/EAL domain proteins) in the genome of A. baumannii strain 17978. Enzymatic activity of the encoded proteins was assessed by molecular cloning and expression in the model organisms Salmonella typhimurium and Vibrio cholerae. Ten of the eleven GGDEF/EAL proteins altered the rdar morphotype of S. typhimurium and the rugose morphotype of V. cholerae. The over expression of three GGDEF proteins exerted a pronounced effect on colony formation of A. baumannii on Congo Red agar plates. Distinct panels of GGDEF/EAL proteins were found to alter biofilm formation and surface associated motility of A. baumannii upon over expression. The GGDEF protein A1S_3296 appeared as a major diguanylate cyclase regulating macro-colony formation, biofilm formation and the surface associated motility.

Carabus japonicus exhibits considerable variation in adult body size across geographical locations depending on the larval environment. To investigate the effects of body size divergence on male mating traits, spermatophore deposition and weight, copulation duration, and post-copulatory mounting were observed using male-female pairs from C. japonicus populations with different body sizes. Then, variables with high predictive power on the mating traits were identified from individual characteristics. When the male was slightly smaller than his mate, spermatophore deposition likely succeeded, suggesting that mechanical size-assortative insemination determined male body size. Although male reproductive organ size was positively correlated with male body size, spermatophore weight was not significantly affected by male body size, whereas copulation duration decreased with increasing male body size. Enlarged males, with a high capacity for spermatophore production, could increase paternity by decreasing copulation duration and increasing mating frequency. Such shifts in mating tactics would alter selection pressures of intra- and intersexual interactions (e.g., sperm competition and sexual conflict). Genital dimensions also affected mating traits other than copulatory duration. Thus, ecological heterogeneity has the potential to lead to divergences in sexual traits, such as genital morphology, through body size divergence.",5,5,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity

This study evaluated the effect of a mixed surfactant system on the apparent Henry's law constant of tetrachloroethylene (PCE) and the efficiency of PCE removal from surfactant solutions using a lab-scale hollow fiber membrane contactor. Results show that the presence of surfactant significantly reduced the apparent Henry's law constant of PCE, and the reduction was proportional to the total surfactant concentration. PCE removal efficiency by membrane air-stripping (MAS) decreased as the surfactant system transitioned from solubilization to supersolubilization. Besides significantly reducing the apparent volatility of VOCs, the presence of surfactant brings additional mass transfer resistance in air-stripping, which makes it difficult to achieve high levels of contaminant removal, even at very high air/liquid (A/L) ratios. In contrast, multipass/multistage MAS operated at low A/L ratios could achieve near 100% contaminant removal because of less mass transfer limitation during each stripping pass/stage. Experimental results, together with model calculations demonstrate multipass (and multistage) air-stripping as a cost-effective alternative for removing VOCs from surfactant micellar solutions compared to the options of using large air strippers or operating at high A/L ratios.

Its overexpression has been suggested as a strategy improving survival of transplanted muscle precursors. Results: Here we demonstrated that HMOX1 inhibits differentiation of myoblasts and modulates miRNA processing: downregulates Lin28 and DGCR8, lowers the total pool of cellular miRNAs, and specifically blocks induction of myomirs. Genetic or pharmacological activation of HMOX1 in C2C12 cells reduces the abundance of miR-1, miR-133a, miR-133b, and miR-206, which is accompanied by augmented production of SDF-1 and miR-146a, decreased expression of MyoD, myogenin, and myosin, and disturbed formation of myotubes. Similar relationships between HMOX1 and myomirs were demonstrated in murine primary satellite cells isolated from skeletal muscles of HMOX1(+/+), HMOX1(+/-), and HMOX1(-/-) mice or in human rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines. Inhibition of myogenic development is independent of antioxidative properties of HMOX1. Instead it is mediated by CO-dependent inhibition of c/EBP delta binding to myoD promoter, can be imitated by SDF-1, and partially reversed by enforced expression of miR-133b and miR-206. Control C2C12 myoblasts injected to gastrocnemius muscles of NOD-SCID mice contribute to formation of muscle fibers. In contrast, HMOX1 overexpressing C2C12 myoblasts form fast growing, hyperplastic tumors, infiltrating the surrounding tissues, and disseminating to the lungs. Innovation: We evidenced for the first time that HMOX1 inhibits differentiation of myoblasts, affects the miRNA processing enzymes, and modulates the miRNA transcriptome. Conclusion: HMOX1 improves the survival of myoblasts, but concurrently through regulation of myomirs, may act similarly to oncogenes, increasing the risk of hyperplastic growth of myogenic precursors.

Recent studies of humans and mice have shown that many age-related diseases, including cancer, are strongly correlated with immunity, and macrophages play particularly important roles in immune regulation. Therefore, NMR macrophages may contribute to their unique phenotypes. However, studies of the roles of macrophages are limited by material restrictions and the lack of an established experimental strategy. In this study, we developed a flow cytometric strategy to identify NMR macrophages. The NMR macrophages were extractable using an off-the-shelf anti-CD11b antibody, M1/70, and forward/side scatter data obtained by flow cytometry. NMR macrophages proliferated in response to human/mouse recombinant M-CSF and engulfed Escherichia coli particles. Interestingly, the majority of NMR macrophages exhibited co-staining with an anti-NK1.1 antibody, PK136. NK1.1 antigen crosslinking with PK136 results in mouse NK cell stimulation; similarly, NMR macrophages proliferated in response to NK1.1 antibody treatment.

The purpose of this article aims at identifying the characteristics of children born in families where there are more than two children; revealing the differences of children from small families; the influence of society's attitude to having many children and how this affects the socio-psychological well-being of the phenomenon under study; and studying the factors that influence the socio-cultural capital of the younger generation.MethodsThe study was conducted using the methods of analysis, synthesis, concretization, generalization, comparison, and questioning.ResultsA comparison of the conducted sociological research with the results of secondary sociological and psychological studies made it possible to take a comprehensive look at the existing problems in the context of having many children and conclude that the material problems of families with several children are more profound problems that often require the intervention of specialists, but are not realized by the parents of many children themselves. The use of the presented theoretical methods made it possible to reveal the socio-psychological features of the development of children from large families, to identify factors affecting the development of the younger generation, and to substantiate the reasons why large families are in most cases classified as a risk group.ConclusionThe conclusions obtained in the article can be used in the formation of the social policy of the state, in the course of teaching social and humanitarian disciplines, and in providing psychological counselling to the type of family under study.",0,0,Social Work

Here the authors describe three Arabidopsis methyltransferases that direct H3K4me1 and propose that one methyltransferase works co-transcriptionally while the others are recruited to genomic and epigenomic features. Mono-, di-, and trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me1/2/3) are associated with transcription, yet it remains controversial whether H3K4me1/2/3 promote or result from transcription. Our previous characterizations of Arabidopsis H3K4 demethylases suggest roles for H3K4me1 in transcription. However, the control of H3K4me1 remains unexplored in Arabidopsis, in which no methyltransferase for H3K4me1 has been identified. Here, we identify three Arabidopsis methyltransferases that direct H3K4me1. Analyses of their genome-wide localization using ChIP-seq and machine learning reveal that one of the enzymes cooperates with the transcription machinery, while the other two are associated with specific histone modifications and DNA sequences. Importantly, these two types of localization patterns are also found for the other H3K4 methyltransferases in Arabidopsis and mice. These results suggest that H3K4me1/2/3 are established and maintained via interplay with transcription as well as inputs from other chromatin features, presumably enabling elaborate gene control.",5,5,Science & Technology - Other Topics

We show that C. pneumoniae utilizes host innate immune signaling NLRP3/ASC/caspase-1 inflammasome for intracellular growth. Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) secreted mature interleukin-1 beta upon infection with C. pneumoniae depending on the NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Intracellular growth of C. pneumoniae was severely impaired in BMMs from Nlrp3(-/-), Asc(-/-) and Casp1(-/-) mice but not wild type or Nlrc4(-/-) mice. Furthermore defective NLRP3 inflammasome components led to accumulation of lipid droplets inside the infected BMMs, suggesting that uptake and/or utilization of lipids is disturbed in the absence of NLRP3 inflammasome activation. These results suggest C. pneumoniae has evolved to harness both host innate immune response and NLRP3 inflammasome activation, for the acquisition of essential nutrients necessary for intracellular growth.

QuantAFM allows fast analysis of AFM images, including image preprocessing, object segmentation, and quantification of different structural parameters to assess DNA accessibility of nucleosomes. A comparison of nucleosomes reconstituted with and without linker histone H1 quantified H1's already described ability of compacting the nucleosome. We further employed nucleosomes bearing two charge-modifying mutations at position R81 and R88 in histone H2A (H2A R81E/R88E) to characterize DNA accessibility under destabilizing conditions. Upon H2A mutation, even in presence of H1, the DNA opening angle at the entry/exit site was increased and the DNA wrapping length around the histone core was reduced. Interestingly, a distinct opening of the less bendable DNA side was observed upon H2A mutation, indicating an enhancement of the intrinsic asymmetry of the Widom-601 nucleosomes.

However, whether sex differences exist in the association between social cognition and neurocognition are not known. We aimed to investigate the contribution of areas of neurocognition to theory of mind (ToM) and hostility bias, representing social cognition, according to sex in early course schizophrenia. MethodsIn this cross-sectional study, we assessed neurocognition using the Japanese version of the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS) and assessed the ToM and hostility bias subdomains of social cognition using the Social Cognition Screening Questionnaire (SCSQ) in 131 participants (65 female, 66 male) diagnosed with schizophrenia within 5 years of onset. Sex differences were analyzed using t-tests. The associations of neurocognitive subdomains with ToM and hostility bias according to sex were analyzed using multiple regression analysis. Results were adjusted by age, estimated premorbid intelligence quotient, and symptomatology. ResultsNo sex differences were found in ToM (p = 0.071) or hostility bias (p = 0.057). Higher verbal fluency was significantly associated with higher ToM in females (p < 0.01), whereas higher executive function was significantly associated with higher ToM in males (p < 0.05). Higher verbal fluency was significantly associated with lower hostility bias in females (p < 0.05), whereas neurocognition and hostility bias were not significantly associated in males.

Molecular weight of MO protein was determined by gel-permeation chromatography (GPC) method while its amino acids were quantified by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The number-(M-n) and weight-average molecular weights (M-w) of MO protein were 1.53 x 10(4) and 1.61 x 10(4) g/mol, respectively. Different effective conditions on adsorption protein on nanosilica including contact time, pH, adsorbent dosage, and ionic strength were systematically optimized and found to be 180 min, 10, 10 mg/mL and 1 mM KCl, respectively. The surface charge change by zeta potential, surface modification by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and adsorption isotherms demonstrated that protein adsorption on nanosilica was governed by both electrostatic and non-electrostatic interactions. Application of protein functionalized nanosilica (ProFNS) in LFX and DCF removal were also thoroughly studied. The selected conditions for LFX and DCF removal using ProFNS were 1 mM KCl for both LFX and DCF; pH 8 and pH 6; contact time 90 and 120 min, and adsorption dosage 10 and 5 mg/ml for LFX and DCF, respectively. Adsorption isotherms of protein on nanosilica as well as LFX and DCF onto ProFNS at different ionic strengths were reasonably fitted by the two-step model while a pseudo-second-order model could fit adsorption kinetic well. The removal of LFX and DCF using ProFNS significantly increased from 51.51% to 87.35%, and 7.97%-50.02%, respectively. High adsorption capacities of 75.75 mg/g for LFX and 59.52 mg/g for DCF, indicate that ProFNS is a great performance for pharmaceutical residues removal in water environment.",9,9,Environmental Sciences & Ecology

This snail presents a considerable resistance to pollutants and may successfully face stressful events. Thanks to the unusual possibility to perform several hemolymph collections without affecting its survival, P. canaliculata is a good model to study the hematopoietic process and the hemocyte turnover in molluscs. Here we have analyzed the effects of repeated hemolymph withdrawals on circulating hemocyte populations and pericardial organs, i.e., the heart, the main vessels entering and leaving the heart and the ampulla, of P. canaliculata. Our experiments revealed that the circulating hemocyte populations were maintained constant after 3 collections performed in 48 h. The tissue organization of the heart and the vessels remained unaltered, whereas the ampulla buffered the effects of hemolymph collections acting as hemocyte reservoir, and its original organization was progressively lost by the repeated hemolymph withdrawals. The hematopoietic tissue of P. canaliculata was evidenced here for the first time. It is positioned within the pericardial cavity, in correspondence of the principle veins. Mitoses within the hematopoietic tissue were not influenced by hemolymph collections, and circulating hemocytes never presented mitotic activity. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The composition and morphology of the reduced phases were characterized by X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). The reduction progression of MoO3 catalyst was attained with different reductant types and concentration (10% H-2/N-2, 10% and 20% CO/N-2 (%, v/v)). Two different modes of reduction process were applied. The first approach of reduction involved non-isothermal mode reduction up to 700 degrees C, while the second approach of reduction involved the isothermal mode reduction for 60 min at 700 degrees C. Hydrogen temperature programmed reduction (H-2-TPR) results showed the reduction progression of three-stage reduction of MoO3 (Mo6+ / Mo5+ -> Mo4+ -> Mo-0) with Mo5+ and Mo4+. XRD analysis confirmed the formation of Mo4O11 phase as an intermediate phase followed by MoO2 phase. After 60 min of isothermal reduction, peaks of metallic molybdenum (Mo) appeared. Whereas, FESEM analysis showed porous crater-like structure on the surface cracks of MoO2 layer which led to the growth of Mo phase. Meanwhile, the reduction of MoO3 catalyst in 10% carbon monoxide (CO) showed the formation of unstable intermediate phase of Mo9O26 at the early stage of reduction. Furthermore, by increasing 20% CO led to the carburization of MoO2 phase, resulted in the formation of Mo2C rather than the formation of metallic Mo, as confirmed by XPS analysis. Therefore, the presented study shows that hydrogen gave better reducibility due to smaller molecular size, which contributed to high diffusion rate and achieved deeper penetration into the MoO3 catalyst compared to carbon monoxide reductant. Hence, the reduction of MoO3 in carbon monoxide atmosphere promoted the formation of Mo2C which was in agreement with the thermodynamic assessment. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Despite the importance of biliverdin reductase in maintaining the redox balance, the molecular details of the reaction it catalyses remain unknown. Here we present the crystal structure of biliverdin reductase in complex with biliverdin and NADP(+). Unexpectedly, two biliverdin molecules, which we designated the proximal and distal biliverdins, bind with stacked geometry in the active site. The nicotinamide ring of the NADP(+) is located close to the reaction site on the proximal biliverdin, supporting that the hydride directly attacks this position of the proximal biliverdin. The results of mutagenesis studies suggest that a conserved Arg185 is essential for the catalysis. The distal biliverdin probably acts as a conduit to deliver the proton from Arg185 to the proximal biliverdin, thus yielding bilirubin.",6,6,Science & Technology - Other Topics

COR (1) functions as a ligand of the COI1-JAZ co-receptor, which is the exclusive receptor of 2. Recently, a new role for 1 as a plant virulence factor for Pseudomonas syringae has attracted the attention of plant scientists. Bacteria invade the plant apoplast through stomatal pores. The host plant then responds to the bacterial invasion by closing the stomatal pores (stomatal defense). COR (1) functions as a bacterial chemical weapon that secures the path of infection by reopening the closed stomata. The mechanism is thought to involve inhibition of abscisic acid-signaling through the COI1-JAZ pathway. Thus, 1 plays an important role in plant-microbe interactions by abrogating the plant immune response. In this study, we synthesized seven analogues of 1 with naturally occurring a-amino acids and assessed their effect on stomata in a model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana. Structure-activity relationship studies of the analogues coupled with genetic studies and in silico docking analyses with COI1-JAZ strongly suggested that stomatal reopening induced by 1 may not rely on the COI1-JAZ signaling pathway. Our results suggest that stomatal reopening is triggered by 1 in conjunction with the conventional COI1-JAZ mode of action.",12,12,Chemistry

Here, we present a proteomics study on inguinal lymph nodes of piglets inoculated with PCV2, in order to better understand the pathogenesis of postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome and the pathways might be affected after infection.

More than 100 proteins were found to be differentially regulated and the results obtained by the two strategies were fairly concordant but also complementary, the O-18 labelling approach being a more robust alternative. Analysis of these proteins by systems biology tools revealed the implication of acute phase response and NrF2-mediated oxidative stress, suggesting a putative role for these pathways in the pig immune response.

After SB treatment, there were no significant improvements in the outcomes of the Wingate and dummy throw tests.

Methods: The study was conducted in 50 healthy women with normal menstrual cycles as control group and 50 healthy women receiving oral contraceptive pill for at least three menstrual cycles. Homocysteine concentration was assayed by an enzyme immunoassay method and a colorimetric assay was used for determination of NO levels. Results: After 3 months of treatment, homocysteine levels were significantly increased (P = 0.027), and there was a significant and considerable decrease (P = 0.048) in NO concentration of oral contraceptive pill (OCP) consumers.

No research has attempted to examine underlying mechanisms of HPV vaccine uptake disparities among Asian-Americans. Using the P3 (practice, provider, and patient) model, this study aimed to identify practice-, provider-, and patient-level determinants of Asian-Americans' HPV vaccine intention and uptake. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of published literature regarding practice-, provider- and patient-level determinants of vaccine intention (e.g., intention, willingness, or acceptability) and uptake (e.g., initiation or completion). Eligible studies were those presenting empirical/original data, focusing on Asian populations in the U.S., including outcomes related to HPV vaccine intention and uptake, and analyzing data on factors associated with these outcomes separately for Asian groups. Results: Twenty-six studies (19 quantitative and 7 qualitative studies) were included in the review. Most commonly studied subgroups were Koreans (n = 9), Chinese (n = 6), and Cambodians (n = 5). Studies showed varied prevalence across subgroups (intention: 23.4%-72%; initiation: 14%-67%; completion: 9%-63%). Only 3 studies included measurements of practice-level determinants (language services, insurance policy). Twelve studies measured provider-level determinants (most commonly documented: HPV vaccine recommendation). All studies measured patient-level determinants (most commonly documented: HPV and HPV vaccine knowledge, perceived safety, perceived susceptibility, and perceived relationship between HPV vaccine and sexual activity). Conclusions: Existing research on determinants of HPV vaccine intention and uptake among AsianAmericans currently lacks measurements of practice-level constructs and perspectives of clinic staff and providers, which are needed to guide system-level interventions and provider training. Data regarding patient-level determinants suggest that interventions for Asian-American populations can focus on providing educational information in culturally-appropriate manners, leveraging familial influences, and attending to access-related or cultural beliefs about HPV vaccine. Interventions should take into account varied vaccine intention and uptake prevalence in different Asian subgroups. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Vaccines are the best available countermeasure to induce effective immunity against infection with seasonal influenza viruses; however, the breadth of antibody responses in infection versus vaccination is quite different. Here, we show that nasal infection controls two sequential processes to induce neutralizing IgG antibodies recognizing the hemagglutinin (HA) of heterotypic strains. The first is viral replication in the lung, which facilitates exposure of shared epitopes that are otherwise hidden from the immune system. The second process is the germinal center (GC) response, in particular, IL-4 derived from follicular helper T cells has an essential role in the expansion of rare GC-B cells recognizing the shared epitopes. Therefore, the combination of exposure of the shared epitopes and efficient proliferation of GC-B cells is critical for generating broadly-protective antibodies. These observations provide insight into mechanisms promoting broad protection from virus infection. The reasons why influenza infection promotes a broader antibody response compared with vaccines are not fully understood. Here the authors show that unmasking of haemagglutinin epitopes and IL-4 signals in the germinal centre contribute to broader antibody responses after infection.",14,16,Science & Technology - Other Topics

During food ingestion, masticatory muscles generate the required masticatory force. The magnitude of applied masticatory force has long been believed to be closely correlated with the shape of the jawbone. However, both the mechanism underlying this correlation and evidence of causation remain largely to be determined. Here, we established a novel mouse model of increased mastication in which mice were fed with a hard diet (HD) to elicit greater masticatory force. A novel in silico computer simulation indicated that the masticatory load onto the jawbone leads to the typical bone profile seen in the individuals with strong masticatory force, which was confirmed by in vivo micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) analyses. Mechanistically, increased mastication induced Insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 and suppressed sclerostin in osteocytes. IGF-1 enhanced osteoblastogenesis of the cells derived from tendon. Together, these findings indicate that the osteocytes balance the cytokine expression upon the mechanical loading of increased mastication, in order to enhance bone formation.

Taking advantage of the simple genomic GluA organization in ascidians, we knocked down (KD) GluAs in Ciona and observed severe impairments in formation of the ocellus, a photoreceptive organ used during the swimming stage, and in resorption of the tail and body axis rotation during metamorphosis to the adult stage. These defects could be rescued by injection of KD-resistant GluAs. GluA KD phenotypes could also be reproduced by expressing a GluA mutant that dominantly inhibits glutamate-evoked currents.

In unperturbed cells, Mrc1 interacts independently with both the N-terminal and C-terminal halves of Pol2 (Pol2N and Pol2C). Strikingly, phosphorylation of Mrc1 during the S phase checkpoint abolishes Pol2N binding, but not Pol2C interaction. Mrc1 is required to stabilize Pol2 at replication forks stalled in HILI.

Gas chromatography and Mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) spectra showed therapeutically relevant secondary metabolites present in the rice varieties. Precisely, this is the first report about the metabolites of traditional rice varieties to the best of our knowledge. PTS displayed higher DPPH radical scavenging and total antioxidant activity, whereas, EPS had the significant capacity to reduce ferric ions and superoxide anions. The alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase inhibitory concentration reveal the effectiveness of PTS and EPS in type-II diabetes management.

By transplanting exogeneous nephron progenitor cells (NPCs) into the metanephric mesenchyme of a xenogeneic foetus, we aimed to regenerate neo- kidneys that originate from transplanted NPCs. Previously, we generated a transgenic mouse model enabling drug-induced ablation of NPCs (the Six2-iDTR mouse). We demonstrated that eliminating existing native host NPCs allowed their 100% replacement with donor mouse or rat NPCs, which could generate neo-nephrons on a culture dish. To apply this method to humans in the future, we examined the possibility of the in vivo regeneration of nephrons between different species via NPC replacement. We injected NPCs-containing rat renal progenitor cells and diphtheria toxin below the renal capsule of E13.5 metanephroi (MNs) of Six2-iDTR mice; the injected MNs were then transplanted into recipient rats treated with immunosuppressants. Consequently, we successfully regenerated rat/mouse chimeric kidneys in recipient rats receiving the optimal immunosuppressive therapy. We revealed a functional connection between the neo-glomeruli and host vessels and proper neo-glomeruli filtration. In conclusion, we successfully regenerated interspecies kidneys in vivo that acquired a vascular system. This novel strategy may represent an effective method for human kidney regeneration.",13,13,Science & Technology - Other Topics

With the expansion of urban life, humans are daily exposed to noise pollution which can cause anxiety and disorders in cognitive activities. The present study was aimed to investigate the impact of sub-chronic urban traffic noise pollution on learning, memory and anxiety-like behavior in adult male rats. Deis. Methods: Thirty two adult male Wistar rats (weighing 275-300g) were used in the present experimental study. The animals were divided into two groups: the control and the noiseexposed. The rats in the test group were exposed to a 90dB noise recorded from a crowded street traffic for 6h/10 days. Control rats were intact. Morris water maze (MWM) and an elevated plus maze (EPM) were used to assess spatial learning and memory and anxiety-like behavior in rats. Its. Results: The findings displayed that both control and noise-exposed group improved their maze steering over 4 days of experiment in MWM; however, noise-exposed group had more latency and traveled-distance in MWM to find the hidden platform in probe trial compared to those of control (P<0.05). Moreover, noise-exposed group showed a significant increase in weight gain compared to the control group (P<0.05). In addition, the spent time in open arm of the EPM was significantly decreased compared to controls (P<0.05). Conclusions: Urban traffic noise pollution for a short-term period causes a meaningful increase on weight gain, disorders in retrieval memory and increase in anxiety-like behavior in rats.",3,3,Physiology

Here, we demonstrate one such inference about the health of thermally aged cast austenitic stainless steels. Observations of surface acoustic wave peak (SAW) splitting correlate with spinodal decompositioninduced embrittlement as destructively measured by Charpy impact energy. Elastodynamic calculations and molecular dynamics simulations of the effects of spinodal decomposition on elastic moduli support that the new acoustic modes present are due to stiffening in the delta-ferrite domains.

In recent years, neutrosophic soft sets (NS-sets), a combination of soft and neutrosophic sets, have emerged as outstanding candidates in this field. If neutrosophic sets are used to handle problems involving imprecise, indeterminate, and inconsistent data, soft sets are used to deal with uncertainties that classical tools cannot control. This paper defines a new concept based on NS-sets, called the sequence of NS-sets (NSS-sequence). Their inclusions, special types, operations, distances are determined with reasonable, convincing, and well-proven properties. Furthermore, we also propose an algorithm for the decision-making problem on NS-sequence and apply it in medical diagnosis by a real-life experiment.

We searched B. mori SOD (BmSOD) genes using genome database, and we analyzed their function under different type of oxidative stress. Consequently, we identified four new types of BmSODs in addition to the three types already known. Two of the seven types had a unique domain architecture that has not been discovered previously in the SOD family, and they were expressed in different tissues and developmental stages. Furthermore, these BmSODs responded differently to several kinds of stressors.

The L protein harbors the HBV-derived infection machinery; therefore, BNC can encapsulate payloads such as drugs, nucleic acids, and proteins and deliver them into human hepatocytes specifically in vitro and in vivo. To diversify the possible functions of BNC, we generated ZZ-BNC by replacing the domain indispensable for the human hepatotrophic property of BNC (N-terminal region of L protein) with the tandem form of the IgG Fc-binding Z domain of Staphylococcus aureus protein A. Thus, the ZZ-BNC is an active targeting-based drug delivery system (DDS) nanocarrier that depends on the specificity of the IgGs displayed. However, the Z domain limits the animal species and subtypes of IgGs that can be displayed on ZZ-BNC. In this study, we introduced into BNC an Ig kappa light chain-binding B1 domain of Finegoldia magna protein L (protein-L B1 domain) and an Ig Fc-binding C2 domain of Streptococcus species protein G (protein-G C2 domain) to produce LG-BNC. The LL-BNC was constructed in a similar way using a tandem form of the protein-L B1 domain. Both LG-BNC and LL-BNC could display rat IgGs, mouse IgG1 human IgG3, and human IgM, all of which not binding to ZZ-BNC, and accumulate in target cells in an antibody specificity-dependent manner. Thus, these BNCs could display a broad spectrum of Igs, significantly improving the prospects for BNCs as active targeting-based DDS nanocarriers. Statement of Significance We previously reported that ZZ-BNC, bio-nanocapsule deploying the IgG-binding Z domain of protein A, could display cell-specific antibody in an oriented immobilization manner, and act as an active targeting-based DDS nanocarrier. Since the Z domain can only bind to limited types of Igs, we generated BNCs deploying other Ig-binding domains: LL-BNC harboring the tandem form of Ig-binding domain of protein L, and LG-BNC harboring the Ig binding domains of protein L and protein G sequentially. Both BNCs could display a broader spectrum of Igs than does the ZZ-BNC. When these BNCs displayed anti-CD11 c IgG or anti-EGFR IgG, both of which cannot bind to Z domain, they could bind to and then enter their respective target cells. (C) 2016 Acta Materialia Inc.

The virulence of V.parahaemolyticus is dependent upon a type III secretion system (T3SS2). One effector for T3SS2, VopC, is a homologue of the catalytic domain of cytotoxic necrotizing factor (CNF), and was recently reported to be a Rho family GTPase activator and to be linked to internalization of V.parahaemolyticus by non-phagocytic cultured cells. Here, we provide direct evidence that VopC deamidates Rac1 and CDC42, but not RhoA, in vivo. Our results alsosuggest that VopC, through its activation of Rac1, contributes to formation of actin stress fibres in infected cells. Invasion of host cells, which occurs at a low frequency, does not seem linked to Rac1 activation, but instead appears to require CDC42. Finally, using an infant rabbit model of V.parahaemolyticus infection, we show that the virulence of V.parahaemolyticus is not dependent upon VopC-mediated invasion. Genetic inactivation of VopC did not impair intestinal colonization nor reduce signs of disease, including fluid accumulation, diarrhoea and tissue destruction. Thus, although VopC can promote host cell invasion, such internalization is not a critical step of the disease process, consistent with the traditional view of V.parahaemolyticus as an extracellular pathogen.",28,31,Cell Biology; Microbiology

Typically, a reduction in the mitochondrial membrane potential results in Parkin-mediated ubiquitylation of OMM proteins, which are then targeted for proteasomal and mitophagic degradation. The role of ubiquitylation of OMM proteins with non-degradative fates, however, remains poorly understood. In this study, we find that the mitochondrial E3 ubiquitin ligase MITOL/March5 translocates from depolarized mitochondria to peroxisomes following mitophagy stimulation. This unusual redistribution is mediated by peroxins (peroxisomal biogenesis factors) Pex3/16 and requires the E3 ligase activity of Parkin, which ubiquitylates K268 in the MITOL C-terminus, essential for p97/VCP-dependent mitochondrial extraction of MITOL.

With these definitions, we construct simple examples of Lorentzian tensor networks, based on Gaussian models of fermions, and solve the spectrum for a choice of inertial frame. In particular, the tensor network can be viewed as a periodically driven Floquet system that bypasses the doubling problem and gives rise to fermions with exactly linear dispersion relations. We will find that a boost operator connecting different inertial frames and notions of Rindler observers can be defined and that important physics in Lorentz invariant quantum field theory, such as the Unruh effect, can be captured by such a skeleton of spacetime.

In vivo physiological recordings revealed that sensory stimulation induced sequential S1 to M2 followed by M2 to S1 neural activity. The top-down projection from M2 to S1 initiated dendritic spikes and persistent firing of S1 layer 5 (L5) neurons.

However, the association between larger-scale environmental factors such as living conditions and mental health problems during the pandemic is currently unknown. Methods: A nationwide, cross-sectional internet survey was conducted in Japan between August and September 2020 to examine the association between urbanization level and neighborhood deprivation as living conditions and COVID-19 case numbers by prefecture. Prevalence ratios (PRs) for severe psychological distress, suicidal ideation, and new-onset suicidal ideation during the pandemic were adjusted for potential confounders. Results: Among 24,819 responses analyzed, the prevalence of mental health problems was 9.2% for severe psychological distress and 3.6% for new-onset suicidal ideation. PRs for severe psychological distress were significantly associated with higher urbanization level (highest PR = 1.30, 95% CI = 1.08-1.56). PRs for newonset suicidal ideation were significantly associated with higher urbanization level (highest PR = 1.83, 95% CI = 1.37-2.45) and greater neighborhood deprivation (highest PR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.06-1.72).

The colonies' phylogenetic analysis, derived from the 16S rRNA gene sequences, was evaluated with genusLactobacillus pentosusand achieved a similarity value of 99%. Raman spectroscopy in optical densities of 600 nm (OD600) were used for six consecutive days to observe the changes of the cell growth rate. The values of OD600 were well fitted with the regression model. From this work, M1 was found to be the longest lag phase in 18 h, and it was 17% to 27% longer compared to M3 and M6, respectively. However, the samples of M3 and M6 showed the shortest duration in reaching 0.5 of OD600 nm (16 h) which was enhanced by 80% and 96% compared to M1, respectively. These studies will be of significance when applied in determining the bacteria growth curve and in assessing the growth behavior for the strain in human breast milk.",2,2,Engineering

Multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are of interest because of their ability to differentiate to form myogenic cells in situ. In the present study, methods were developed to expand cultures of MSCs and to promote the myogenic differentiation of these cells, which were then used in a new approach for the treatment of DMD. MSC cultures enriched in CD271(+) cells grew better than CD271-depleted cultures. The transduction of CD271(+) MSCs with MyoD caused myogenic differentiation in vitro and the formation of myotubes expressing late myogenic markers. CD271(+) MSCs in the myogenic cell lineage transplanted into dog leukocyte antigen (DLA)-identical dogs formed clusters of muscle-like tissue. Intra-arterial injection of the CD271(+) MSCs resulted in engraftment at the site of the cardiotoxin (CTX)-injured muscle. Dogs affected by X-linked muscular dystrophy in Japan (CXMD) treated with an intramuscular injection of CD271(+) MSCs similarly developed muscle-like tissue within 8-12 weeks in the absence of immunosuppression. In the newly formed tissues, developmental myosin heavy chain (dMyHC) and dystrophin were upregulated. These findings demonstrate that a cell transplantation strategy using CD271(+) MSCs may offer a promising treatment approach for patients with DMD.",39,40,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Genetics & Heredity; Research & Experimental Medicine

It is considered to be a master regulator because the glands do not form when Gcm2 is deficient. Remarkably, Gcm2 expression is maintained throughout the fetal stage and after birth. Considering the Gcm2 function in embryonic stages, it is predicted that Gcm2 maintains parathyroid cell differentiation and survival in adults. However, there is a lack of research regarding the function of Gcm2 in adulthood. Therefore, we analyzed Gcm2 function in adult tamoxifen-inducible Gcm2 conditional knockout mice. One month after tamoxifen injection, Gcm2-knockout mice showed no significant difference in serum calcium, phosphate, and PTH levels and in the expressions of calcium-sensing receptor (Casr) and parathyroid hormone (Pth), whereas Ki-67 positive cells were decreased and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) dUTP Nick-End Labeling (TUNEL) positive cell number did not change, as compared with those of controls. Seven months after tamoxifen injection, Gcm2-knockout mice showed shrinkage of the parathyroid glands and fewer parathyroid cells. A significant decrease was noted in Casr- and Pth-expressing cells and serum PTH and Ca levels, whereas serum phosphate levels increased, as compared with those of controls. All our results concluded that a reduction of Gcm2 expression leads to a reduction of parathyroid cell proliferation, an increase in cell death, and an attenuation of parathyroid function. Therefore, we indicate that Gcm2 plays a prominent role in adult parathyroid cell proliferation and maintenance.",18,21,Science & Technology - Other Topics

Herein, various 3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]quinoline-containing compounds were rapidly assembled via the Doebner-Povarov multicomponent reaction from the readily available 5-amino-indazole, ketones, and heteroaromatic aldehydes in good yields. The most active compounds potently inhibit the recombinant FLT3 kinase and its mutant forms with nanomolar IC50 values. Docking studies with the FLT3 kinase showed a type I binding mode, where the 3H-pyrazolo group interacts with Cys694 in the hinge region. The compounds blocked the proliferation of AML cell lines harboring oncogenic FLT3-ITD mutations with remarkable IC50 values, which were comparable to the approved FLT3 inhibitor quizartinib.

In this phenotype, lateral dominance is extreme as the plants only retain a macrocotyledon that develops into a leaf-like phyllomorph by means of a basal meristem and do not show apical growth. Gibberellin applications suppressed the basal meristem activity of the macrocotyledon resulting in an isocotylous seedling with two microcotyledons and caused the formation of a primary phyllomorph, which suggests that the groove meristem, a shoot apical meristem equivalent, is released from apical suppression by the basal meristem. Interestingly, uniconazol, a gibberellin biosynthesis inhibitor, also caused a reduction in basal meristem activity, but without primary phyllomorph formation, suggesting that some gibberellin is required for proper function of the basal meristem. Co-application of gibberellin and cytokinin resulted in two macrocotyledons also without phyllomorph formation, which is similar to previous results for cytokinin-only applications. Thus, cytokinin may act downstream in the regulatory pathway of the basal meristem. Our results suggest that the balance between gibberellin and cytokinin in the cotyledons appears thus as key factor in the regulation of lateral and apical dominance in Streptocarpus. Their interplay may well be the primary explanation for the great diversity in growth form exhibited in species of this genus. Our work shows that small imbalances of hormones in early stages of plant development can have major effects on the final phenotype.",5,6,Plant Sciences

In the 2010 Desert Research and Technology Studies (RATS) field test, four crews, each consisting of an astronaut/engineer and field geologist, tested and evaluated various technologies during two weeks of simulated spacewalks in the San Francisco volcanic field, Arizona. These tools consisted of both Apollo-style field geology tools and modern technological equipment not used during the six Apollo lunar landings. The underlying exploration driver for this field test was to establish the protocols and technology needed for an eventual manned mission to an asteroid, the Moon, or Mars. The authors of this paper represent Desert RATS geologist crewmembers as well as two engineers who worked on technology development. Here we present an evaluation and assessment of these tools and technologies based on our first-hand experience of using them during the analog field test.

We previously found that cystatin F (CysF), a cysteine protease inhibitor, is selectively expressed in microglia only in actively demyelinating/remyelinating lesions but ceases expression in chronic lesions, suggesting its role in remyelination. Here, we report the effects of manipulating the expression of CysF and cathepsin C (CatC), a key target of CysF, in a murine model of transgenic demyelinating disease, Plp(4e/-). During the active remyelinating phase, both CysF knockdown (CysFKD) and microglial-selective CatC overexpression (CatCOE) showed a worsening of the demyelination in Plp(4e/-) transgenic mice.

The fraction of reverted austenite in the final microstructure gradually increased with time of ageing at 475 degrees C. Ageing resulted in a gradual slight decline (up to 10%) in yield strength, ultimate tensile strength, and hardness. On the other hand, for all ageing, dwells ductility and impact energy values remained almost unchanged. The reason for this phenomenon lies in the gradual increase in the fraction of reverted austenite during long-term ageing at 475 degrees C and at the same time in the sluggish kinetics of microstructural changes in lath martensite.

Characterizations of the unmodified and modified materials were performed by using XRD, SEM, TGDSC, FT-IR, and BET surface area analyses. Factors influencing the uptake of Pb(II) from aqueous solution, such as pHsolution, ion strength, uptake time, adsorbent dosage, and initial Pb(II) concentration, were examined. The obtained results showed that bentonite clay was successfully modified by HDTMA, resulting in an increase in its surface area by about 70 %. The Pb(II) adsorption onto modified bentonite clay reached equilibrium at pH = 5.0 after 120 min. Studies within the isotherm and kinetic models demonstrated that the adsorption followed the Sips isotherm and pseudo-second-order kinetic models. The maximum monolayer adsorption capacity calculated from the Langmuir model at 30 degrees C was 25.8 mg/g, which is much higher than that obtained for the unmodified sample (18.9 mg/g). The FT-IR and TG-DSC analyses indicated that the formation of inner-sphere complexes plays a fundamental role in the mechanism of Pb(II) uptake onto HDTMA-bentonite clay. This mechanism of Pb(II) adsorption was further investigated, for the first time, by using the positron annihilation lifetime (PAL) and electron momentum (EMD) measurements. The PAL and EMD analyses indicated that the existence of Al and Si mono-vacancies in the HDTMA-bentonite should have essential contributions to the adsorption mechanism. In particular, we found a very interesting mechanism that the Pb(II) adsorption should occur inside the interlayer spaces of the HDTMA-bentonite.",22,22,Environmental Sciences & Ecology

Despite clinical and scientific advances, there remains a need for new approaches to treat retinopathy. Here, we have presented a possible treatment strategy, whereby targeting the small GTPase ARF6 alters VEGFR2 trafficking and reverses signs of pathology in 4 animal models that represent features of diabetic retinopathy and in a fifth model of ocular pathological angiogenesis. Specifically, we determined that the same signaling pathway utilizes distinct GEFs to sequentially activate ARF6, and these GEFs exert distinct but complementary effects on VEGFR2 trafficking and signal transduction. ARF6 activation was independently regulated by 2 different ARF GEFs - ARNO and GEP100. Interaction between VEGFR2 and ARNO activated ARF6 and stimulated VEGFR2 internalization, whereas a VEGFR2 interaction with GEP100 activated ARF6 to promote VEGFR2 recycling via coreceptor binding. Intervening in either pathway inhibited VEGFR2 signal output. Finally, using a combination of in vitro, cellular, genetic, and pharmacologic techniques, we demonstrated that ARF6 is pivotal in VEGFR2 trafficking and that targeting ARF6-mediated VEGFR2 trafficking has potential as a therapeutic approach for retinal vascular diseases such as diabetic retinopathy.",23,24,Research & Experimental Medicine

Using these precursors, the tin halide perovskites, MASnI(3) and FASnI(3), were prepared, and their electronic structures and photophysical properties were examined under inert conditions by means of photoelectron yield spectroscopy as well as absorption and fluorescence spectroscopies. Their valence bands (MASnI3: -5.02 eV; FASnI3: -5.16 eV) are significantly higher than those of MAPbI(3) or the typical hole-transporting materials 2,2', 7,7'-tetrakis(N, N-di-p-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9'-spirobifluorene and poly(bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl) amine).

ASD encompasses a wide-range and severity of symptoms and co-occurring conditions; however, the details of how genetic variation contributes to phenotypic differences are unclear. This creates a challenge for translating genetic evidence into clinically useful knowledge. Sleep disturbances are particularly prevalent co-occurring conditions in ASD, and genetics may inform treatment. Identifying convergent mechanisms with evidence for dysfunction that connect ASD and sleep biology could help identify better treatments for sleep disturbances in these individuals. Methods To identify mechanisms that influence risk for ASD and co-occurring sleep disturbances, we analyzed whole exome sequence data from individuals in the Simons Simplex Collection (n = 2380). We predicted protein damaging variants (PDVs) in genes currently implicated in either ASD or sleep duration in typically developing children. We predicted a network of ASD-related proteins with direct evidence for interaction with sleep duration-related proteins encoded by genes with PDVs. Overrepresentation analyses of Gene Ontology-defined biological processes were conducted on the resulting gene set. We calculated the likelihood of dysfunction in the top overrepresented biological process. We then tested if scores reflecting genetic dysfunction in the process were associated with parent-reported sleep duration. Results There were 29 genes with PDVs in the ASD dataset where variation was reported in the literature to be associated with both ASD and sleep duration. A network of 108 proteins encoded by ASD and sleep duration candidate genes with PDVs was identified. The mechanism overrepresented in PDV-containing genes that encode proteins in the interaction network with the most evidence for dysfunction was cerebral cortex development (GO:0,021,987). Scores reflecting dysfunction in this process were associated with sleep durations; the largest effects were observed in adolescents (p = 4.65 x 10(-3)). Conclusions Our bioinformatic-driven approach detected a biological process enriched for genes encoding a protein-protein interaction network linking ASD gene products with sleep duration gene products where accumulation of potentially damaging variants in individuals with ASD was associated with sleep duration as reported by the parents. Specifically, genetic dysfunction impacting development of the cerebral cortex may affect sleep by disrupting sleep homeostasis which is evidenced to be regulated by this brain region. Future functional assessments and objective measurements of sleep in adolescents with ASD could provide the basis for more informed treatment of sleep problems in these individuals.",0,0,Neurosciences & Neurology

Mutations in CFTR are associated with Cystic Fibrosis (CF), the most common lethal autosomal recessive disorder in Caucasians. While remarkable treatment advances have been made recently in the form of modulator drugs directly rescuing CFTR dysfunction, there is still considerable scope for improvement of therapeutic effectiveness. Here, we report the application of a high-throughput screening variant of the Mammalian Membrane Two-Hybrid (MaMTH-HTS) to map the protein-protein interactions of wild-type (wt) and mutant CFTR (F508del), in an effort to better understand CF cellular effects and identify new drug targets for patient-specific treatments. Combined with functional validation in multiple disease models, we have uncovered candidate proteins with potential roles in CFTR function/CF pathophysiology, including Fibrinogen Like 2 (FGL2), which we demonstrate in patient-derived intestinal organoids has a significant effect on CFTR functional expression.",4,4,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology

The effect of the particle mean diameter and zeta potential on the bacterial behavior, as well as the nanocapsule interactions with bacteria by infra-red spectroscopy were determined. The nanoencapsulation of FA, in lipid-core nanocapsules coated or not with chitosan, modified the biological behavior of the drug and provided better in vitro performance against S. aureus, E. faecalis and S. epidermidis strains. The nanocapsules-bacteria interactions were evaluated by mean diameter, polydispersity index, and zeta potential. Aggregates were formed after contact of the formulations with S. aureus, E. faecalis and S. epidermidis, which results were confirmed by infrared spectra showing a peak at 1651 cm-1 attributed to the stretching mode of C??O, amide I, or stretching mode (C=O) of COO- group (S. aureus), a peak at 1653 cm-1 related to the stretching mode of COO- group, another at 1149 cm-1 associated to C-O-C-ester bonds (E. faecalis), and at 1626 cm-1 the stretching mode C??O (amide I) likely related to carboxylic groups (S. epidermidis).

Methods LNC-CS-(L)-Zn+2-DOX-FA was prepared by self-assembly and interfacial reactions, and characterized using liquid chromatography, particle sizing, transmission electron microscopy, and infrared spectroscopy. Cell viability and cellular uptake were studied using MTT assay and confocal microscopy. Results The presence of lecithin allows the formation of nanocapsules with a lower tendency of agglomeration, narrower size distributions, and smaller diameters due to an increase in hydrogen bonds at the surface. LNC-(L)-CS-Zn+2-DOX-FA, containing 98.00 +/- 2.34 mu g mL(-1) of DOX and 105.00 +/- 2.05 mu g mL(-1) of FA, had a mean diameter of 123 +/- 4 nm and zeta potential of +12.0 +/- 1.3 mV. After treatment with LNC-(L)-CS-Zn+2-DOX-FA (15 mu mol L-1 of DOX), T24 cells had inhibition rates above 80% (24 h) and 90% (48 h), whereas OVCAR-3 cells showed inhibition rates of 68% (24 h) and 93% (48 h), showing higher cytotoxicity than DOX.HCl. The fluorescent-labeled formulation showed a higher capacity of internalization in OVCAR-3 compared to T24 cancer cells. Conclusion Lecithin favored the increase of hydrogen bonds at the surface, leading to a lower tendency of agglomeration for nanocapsules. LNC-CS-(L)-Zn+2-DOX-FA is a promising therapeutic agent against tumor-overexpressing folate receptors.",3,3,Chemistry; Pharmacology & Pharmacy

Our findings highlight both cultural universals and cultural variation. We find a universal negative relation between appropriateness ratings of norm violations and appropriateness ratings of responses in the form of confrontation, social ostracism and gossip. Moreover, we find the country variation in the appropriateness of sanctions to be consistent across different norm violations but not across different sanctions. Specifically, in those countries where use of physical confrontation and social ostracism is rated as less appropriate, gossip is rated as more appropriate.

The most severe class of PBDs-Zellweger spectrum disorder (ZSD)-is caused by mutations in peroxin genes that result in both non-functional peroxisomes and mitochondrial dysfunction. It is unclear, however, how defective peroxisomes contribute to mitochondrial impairment. In order to understand the molecular basis of this inter-organellar relationship, we investigated the fate of peroxisomal mRNAs and proteins in ZSD model systems. We found that peroxins were still expressed and a subset of them accumulated on the mitochondrial membrane, which resulted in gross mitochondrial abnormalities and impaired mitochondrial metabolic function. We showed that overexpression of ATAD1, a mitochondrial quality control factor, was sufficient to rescue several aspects of mitochondrial function in human ZSD fibroblasts. Together, these data suggest that aberrant peroxisomal protein localization is necessary and sufficient for the devastating mitochondrial morphological and metabolic phenotypes in ZSDs.",12,12,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Cell Biology
